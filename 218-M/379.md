# Delisted perps can be abused to prevent `handleBadDebt()`

## Summary

After the perp being delisted, it cannot be liquidated and removed from `openPosiions[]`, as a result, the `handleBadDebt()` can not function to collect credits for insurance. The protocol will forever lose some of the insurance fund as expected, and the insurance will not work as designed.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `handleBadDebt()` function checks that `openPositions[liquidatedTrader]` is empty, and than clear the `primaryCredit[liquidatedTrader]`/`secondaryCredit[liquidatedTrader]`, sending the balance to insurance.
```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol
399:     function handleBadDebt(Types.State storage state, address liquidatedTrader)
400:         external
401:     {
402:         if (
403:             state.openPositions[liquidatedTrader].length == 0 &&
404:             !Liquidation._isSafe(state, liquidatedTrader)
405:         ) {
406:             int256 primaryCredit = state.primaryCredit[liquidatedTrader];
407:             uint256 secondaryCredit = state.secondaryCredit[liquidatedTrader];
408:             state.primaryCredit[state.insurance] += primaryCredit;
409:             state.secondaryCredit[state.insurance] += secondaryCredit;
410:             state.primaryCredit[liquidatedTrader] = 0;
411:             state.secondaryCredit[liquidatedTrader] = 0;
412:             emit HandleBadDebt(
413:                 liquidatedTrader,
414:                 primaryCredit,
415:                 secondaryCredit
416:             );
417:         }
418:     }
```

And the only way to remove a perp from the `openPositions[]` array is through `_realizePnl()`:
```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Position.sol
22:     function _realizePnl(
23:         Types.State storage state,
24:         address trader,
25:         int256 pnl
26:     ) internal {

30:         address[] storage positionList = state.openPositions[trader];
31:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < positionList.length;) {
32:             if (positionList[i] == msg.sender) {
33:                 positionList[i] = positionList[positionList.length - 1];
34:                 positionList.pop();
35:                 break;
36:             }

```


But for a delisted perp, the `onlyRegisteredPerp` modifier will prevent it from `realizePnl()` call.

```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOStorage.sol
34: 
35:     modifier onlyRegisteredPerp() {
36:         require(
37:             state.perpRiskParams[msg.sender].isRegistered,
38:             Errors.PERP_NOT_REGISTERED
39:         );
40:         _;
41:     }

File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol
095:     function realizePnl(address trader, int256 pnl)
096:         external
097:         onlyRegisteredPerp
098:     {
099:         Position._realizePnl(state, trader, pnl);
100:     }

```


A malicious user can intentionally keep the positions of delisted perps, so that the `openPosiions[user]` will never be emptied, and `primaryCredit[user]`/`secondaryCredit[user]` will not be cleared to the insurance. 



## Impact

The protocol will forever lose some of the insurance fund as expected, and the insurance mechanism will not work as designed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Maybe add some admin function to close those delisted perp positions, and enforce the insurance fund collection.
