# M-3: Liquidation in case of delisted collateral

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When collateral is delisted, its value is treated as zero (differing from the market price) when the protocol assesses the account's safety. As a result, certain accounts may become undercollateralized when their collateral is delisted and may be subject to liquidation.
The protocol uses 2 different functions to check if an account is safe depending if the transaction is a withdrawal or a liquidation:

-_isAccountSafe()  for withdrawals using initialMortgageRate
-_isStartLiquidation() for liquidations  using liquidationMortgageRate

This will cause losses to the liquidated user as collateral is liquidated at a discount price.
In the event of under-collateralization, users with delisted collateral deposits are not permitted to withdraw them but the protocol considers them worthless.

## Impact
Delisting collateral can cause losses to certain accounts

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a delisting occurs, users who find themselves in a position at risk of liquidation should be given a specific amount of time to withdraw their assets, sell them on the market, and deposit the necessary amount to keep their account secure.
It's not correct to prevent users to withdraw their assets when the protocol treats them as worthless.
