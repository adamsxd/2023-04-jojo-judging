# Owner holds too much power, can lead to loss of confidence in the protocol

## Summary
Owner has control over many critical changes.
## Vulnerability Detail
Owner has control over almost all parameters in the protocol that can lead to bad consequences. This will lead to users have less confidence in the protocol since they can essentially get RUGGED any second. This will hurt protocol in the long run. If tem is serious about  the protocol they should implement timelock functionality to all functions having a ```onlyOwner``` modifier in the ```JUSDOperation``` file.  This should be taken seriously as we just got a RUG from the owner a few days ago on Arbitrum (Merlin exchange).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a timelock for every function that has an ```onlyOwner``` parameter in the ```JUSDOperation.sol```. This gives users time to act in case owner wants to rug a project.
