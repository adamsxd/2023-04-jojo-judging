# `JUSDBank.isValidOperator` implementation error

## Summary
The `JUSDBank.isValidOperator`  modifier implementation is inconsistent with its  expected functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/// @notice to ensure msg.sender is from account or msg.sender is the sub account of from
    /// so that msg.sender can send the transaction
    modifier isValidOperator(address operator, address client) {
        require(
            msg.sender == client || operatorRegistry[client][operator],
            JUSDErrors.CAN_NOT_OPERATE_ACCOUNT
        );
        _;
    }
```


From the function signature, we could infer that this function is used to judge whether the `operator` is authorized by the `client` to do this operation. However, in the comment and implementation, it checks `msg.sender` rather than `operator`. 

Although in the current `JUSDBank` implementation, functions with this modifier always pass `msg.sender` as `operator`, but for future functions add, or other contracts inherit this contract, the condition `msg.sender == operator` may be false, and this may cause unconscious improper access control, which may lead to user funds lock or loss.

Since in the current implementation it's not dangerous, but it's also potential risk in the future, I'd choose to submit this issue and mark it as Medium. 


## Impact

Improper access control. May cause user fund loss/lock in the future.

## Recommendation
change the  `msg.sender` to `operator` in the modifier body.
