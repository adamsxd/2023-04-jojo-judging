# `FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan` swap asset without any slippage protection

## Summary
There is no  any slippage protection made the `FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan()` swap vulnerable to sandwich attacks, which allowed an attacker to steal assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan()` is used to execute a flash loan, buy JUSD, repay JUSD debt, transfer USDC, and transfer any remaining USDC to the liquidator address. Inside the function,it will swap `asset` token to USDC on third-party AMM as the code below. However ,there is no  any slippage protection made this swap vulnerable to sandwich attacks, which allowed an attacker to steal assets.

```solidity
function JOJOFlashLoan(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes calldata param
    ) external {
        //swapContract swap
        (LiquidateData memory liquidateData, bytes memory originParam) = abi
            .decode(param, (LiquidateData, bytes));
        (
            address approveTarget,
            address swapTarget,
            address liquidator,
            bytes memory data
        ) = abi.decode(originParam, (address, address, address, bytes));
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
        if (success == false) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }
```

## Impact
User's swap can be vulnerable to sandwich attacks.
