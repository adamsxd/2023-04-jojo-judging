# Chainlink might give stale price

## Summary
Lack of validation might lead to project getting stale prices from Chainlink oracle

## Vulnerability Detail
Oracle implementation doesn't check `rawPrice != 0` and `roundId == updatedInRoundId`. Without these verifications, data from the oracle might be stale and incorrect. 

## Impact
Incorrect prices are used.

## Recommendation
add the following lines of code
```solidity
require(rawPrice != 0);
require(roundId == updatedInRoundId);
```
