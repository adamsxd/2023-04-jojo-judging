# `Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` does not lock funds, so timelock can be bypassed

## Summary

`Funding.sol#requestWithdraw` does not lock funds, so timelock can be bypassed

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: lib/Funding.sol
 84     function requestWithdraw(
 85         Types.State storage state,
 86         uint256 primaryAmount,
 87         uint256 secondaryAmount
 88     ) external {
 89         state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
 90         state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
 91         state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
 92             block.timestamp +
 93             state.withdrawTimeLock;
--skip--
100     }
```

 `requestWithdraw` function only record the `primaryAmount` and `secondaryAmount` input by the user, and the amount of funds is not verified or locked. When the attacker exceeds the `requestWithdraw` in advance, after timelock time, he can withdraw any funds through flashloans at any time. The bypass method is as follows:

1. Assuming `withdrawTimeLock` is 10 days
2. Alias prepared 100 addresses to call `questWithdraw`, the amount is 10000 USDC (The actual transaction volume of Alias is only 1000 USDC)
3. 10 days later, Alias chooses any address to trade
4. If Alias wants to withdraw, he can make his funds in the JOJO contract reach 10,000 USDC through a flashloan and then call `executeWithdraw`, which can be withdrawn instantly without locking for a period of time (because he has already called `questWithdraw`)
5. Alias can choose the remaining 99 addresses to continue to trade, repeating this, can completely bypass `withdrawTimeLock`

## Impact

Bypass the `withdrawTimeLick`
