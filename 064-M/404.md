# Withdraw Timelock can be easily bypassed

## Summary
When the user requests a withdrawal, the user must wait for the timelock period in order to withdraw the actual credit. However, it can be easily bypassed, and there are not any risks or costs for doing so.

## Vulnerability Detail
`requestWithdraw` marks the requested amount for withdrawal in the `pendingWithdraw` queue.
```solidity
    function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }
```

After the `withdrawTimelock` has passed, the user can then withdraw the pending amount.
```solidity
    function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
        uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
```

This can be easily bypassed, since `requestWithdraw` is only callable by the owner of the asset, and there's no penalty for maintaining excess amounts for pending withdrawal: there's no change in the actual `primaryCredit` and `secondaryCredit` until the withdrawal is executed. The user can even withdrawal requests for more credits that it's owning.

## Impact

This can enable several malicious acts in the protocol, for example DoS attack for matching orders by executing withdraw just before the order is matched.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Record `to` / `isInternal` in `requestWithdraw`, and let the withdrawal executable by anyone.
