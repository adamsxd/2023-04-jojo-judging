# Withdrawal timelock is bypassable

## Summary
Users can violate system specifications by requesting a withdrawal early, letting `timelock` amount of time pass, deposit and then withdraw immediately.

## Vulnerability Detail
[Funding.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Funding.sol) allows for users to request a withdraw for any amount of tokens, even if they haven't deposited such amount.
[`requestWithdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Funding.sol#L84-L100) lacks this check when writing the pending amounts to be withdrawn.
This allows for users start the `withdrawTimelock` timer before having deposited any funds, ultimately leading to them being able to call `deposit()` and `executeWithdraw()` in quick succession, once the timelock has passed.

## Impact
Violation of system specification

## Code Snippet
The following is PoC test case I've added to smart-contract-EVM/test/fund-test.ts to validate my finding
```ts
it("PoC: bypass timelock by calling withdrawRequest early", async () => {
      await context.dealer.setWithdrawTimeLock("100");
      let d = context.dealer.connect(trader1);
      await d.requestWithdraw(
        utils.parseEther("1000"),
        utils.parseEther("1000")
      );
      
      await timeJump(101);
      
      await d.deposit(          
        utils.parseEther("1000"),
        utils.parseEther("1000"),
        trader1Address
      )
      await checkCredit(context, trader1Address, "1000", "1000");
      
      await d.executeWithdraw(trader1Address, false);
      await checkCredit(context, trader1Address, "0", "0");
    });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce a check within `requestWithdraw()` to ensure the user is requesting to withdraw an amount of credit he has previously deposited.
