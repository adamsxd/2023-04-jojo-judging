```solidity
    function buyJUSD(uint256 amount, address to) external {
        require(isExchangeOpen, JUSDErrors.NOT_ALLOWED_TO_EXCHANGE);
        IERC20(primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), amount);

As written in https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/JUSD, 

JUSD can be freely traded, however, its price is not guaranteed to be equal to Primary asset in the open market, where as mentioned by sponsor, the primary asset is always be USDC

## Impact
If the price of JUSDC > USDC, user will call buyJUSD more often which could lead to protocol loss

## Recommendation
Rather than treating USDC and JUSDC to be always as 1:1. Try to use any pricing oracle to determine what is the current price of JUSDC to determine the amount to be exchanged
