# latestRoundData() has no check for round completeness

## Summary
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices. The functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected and sometimes can lead to funding loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
As pricing retrieval implements the same latestRoundData interface as the Chainlink oracle, I assume that we should add more validation that is suggested in Chainlink's documentation.

getAssetPrice calls out to an oracle with latestRoundData() to get the price of some token. Although the returned timestamp is checked, there is no check for round completeness.

Reference
Chainlink documentation:
https://docs.chain.link/docs/historical-price-data/#historical-rounds

## Impact
If there is a problem with the oracle starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated prices.

As a result, the functions relying on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to funding loss.

## Recommendation
Change the getAssetPrice function,

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        --- (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        --- (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        
                +++(uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        +++ (uint80 USDCRoundID, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt, uint80 USDCAnsweredInRound) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

+++ require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
+++ require(USDCAnsweredInRound >= USDCRoundID, "round not complete");

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```
