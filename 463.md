# JUSD borrow rate calculation error

## Summary
JUSD borrow rate is lower than expected after feeRate changed.

## Vulnerability Detail

the tRate is always calculated from lastTimeStamp. And the lastTimeStamp is initialized in the constructor, and only change when updateBorrowFeeRate. But when update the borrowFeeRate, the past tRate is also accumulated.

With some manual calculation, I found that this formula may not work well. Like if I set the borrowFeeRate to be 20% per year, after 1 year, the tRate is about 1.2; after 2 year, the tRate is 1.4. If I borrow 1000 JUSD 1 year after the construction, the t0BorrowAmount is about 1000 / 1.2; And after another 1 year, the amount I need to repay is about 1000 / 1.2 * 1.4 = 1000 * 1.167. In this way, the borrowFeeRate is not the same as declared in the constructor(expected to be  20%, but in real world be 16.7%). When long time passed, say 2.8 / 2.6 = 7%, which is much less than 20%. I consider this as a vulnerability, but I'd like to ask how do you think about it to choose whether I should submit it.(since now invalid submission will cause penalty) 

My calculation above is based on `updateBorrowFeeRate` every year. Or to say, each time I updateBorrowFeeRate, the actual feeRate will become more lower than the feeRate in the code. That's the vulnerablity.

## Impact

actual fee rate is lower than the expected feeRate in the code, which will mislead users.
