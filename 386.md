# Incentive to self liquidate JUSD

## Summary

Although the JUSD contract disallow liquidation from the same address, the user can bypass it with another wallet in control. The key to prevent users from doing self liquidation is to make it not profitable for traders.


## Vulnerability Detail

The `isValidLiquidator()` check can be circumvented by using another wallet.
```solidity
File: JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol
365:     function isValidLiquidator(address liquidated, address liquidator) internal view {
366:         require(
367:             liquidator != liquidated,
368:             JUSDErrors.SELF_LIQUIDATION_NOT_ALLOWED
369:         );
```


The trader will have incentive to use another wallet to do a self liquidation as long as the `liquidationPriceOff` is not less than the insurance fee.

Assuming, 3% `liquidationPriceOff` and 2% insurance. For a loan of 100,000 JUSD, when liquidated, the difference in `liquidationPriceOff` and insurance fee is 3% - 2% = 1%, 100,000 * 1% = $1,000. 

Even the `liquidationPriceOff` is the same value as insurance fee, there is still a little profit for self liquidation, since in `JUSDBank.sol#_calculateLiquidateAmount()`, `amount.decimalMul(priceOff)` is calculated first, and used as the base amount for `insuranceFee` calculation. With the above example, assuming the insurance fee is increased to 3%, 100,000 JUSD, after priceOff discount, reduced amount is 97% * 100,000 = 97,000. A discount of 3,000. 
`insuranceFee` is 97,000 * 3% = 2,910.
The self liquidation will profit for 3,000 - 2,910 = 90, due to the discounted base amount for insurance fee.

396:         uint256 price = IPriceChainLink(reserve.oracle).getAssetPrice();
397:         uint256 priceOff = price.decimalMul(

399:         );
400:         uint256 liquidateAmount = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(

402:         );
403:         uint256 JUSDBorrowed = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);
404:         /*
405:         liquidateAmount <= JUSDBorrowed
406:         liquidateAmount = amount * priceOff * (1-insuranceFee)
407:         actualJUSD = actualCollateral * priceOff
408:         insuranceFee = actualCollateral * priceOff * insuranceFeeRate
409:         */
410:         if (liquidateAmount <= JUSDBorrowed) {
411:             liquidateData.actualCollateral = amount;
412:             liquidateData.insuranceFee = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(
413:                 reserve.insuranceFeeRate
414:             );
415:             liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidateAmount.decimalDiv(
416:                 tRate
417:             );
418:             liquidateData.actualLiquidated = liquidateAmount;
419:         } else {
420:             //            actualJUSD = actualCollateral * priceOff
421:             //            = JUSDBorrowed * priceOff / priceOff * (1-insuranceFeeRate)
422:             //            = JUSDBorrowed / (1-insuranceFeeRate)
423:             //            insuranceFee = actualJUSD * insuranceFeeRate
424:             //            = actualCollateral * priceOff * insuranceFeeRate
425:             //            = JUSDBorrowed * insuranceFeeRate / (1- insuranceFeeRate)
426:             liquidateData.actualCollateral = JUSDBorrowed
427:                 .decimalDiv(priceOff)
428:                 .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
429:             liquidateData.insuranceFee = JUSDBorrowed
430:                 .decimalMul(reserve.insuranceFeeRate)
431:                 .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
432:             liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
433:             liquidateData.actualLiquidated = JUSDBorrowed;
434:         }

```

## Impact

The trader will have motivation to do self liquidation with another wallet in control. Effectively skip some portion of fund ought to pay to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `JUSDOperation.sol#initReserve()`, add checks for `_liquidationPriceOff` and `_insuranceFeeRate`, to make sure the insurance fee is larger than the discount, so that self liquidation is not profitable.
