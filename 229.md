# Users may deploy a lot of position resulting in insufficient gas fees during liquidation

## Summary

Users may deploy a lot of position resulting in insufficient gas fees during liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: lib/Liquidation.sol
 53     function getTotalExposure(Types.State storage state, address trader)
 54         public
 55         view
 56         returns (
 57             int256 netPositionValue,
 58             uint256 exposure,
 59             uint256 maintenanceMargin
 60         )
 61     {
 62         // sum net value and exposure among all markets
 63         for (uint256 i = 0; i < state.openPositions[trader].length; ) {
--skip--
 84         }
 85     }
```

During liquidation, `_isSafe` function will be called to check the health of the position, and `_isSafe` function will further call the `getTotalExposure` function to traverse all positions of the user.

Malicious users may establish a large number of positions, causing the liquidator to fail the liquidation due to insufficient gas fees.

## Impact

May be exploited to circumvent liquidation
