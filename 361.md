# Chainlink Adaptor does not check Sequencer Uptime

## Summary

Borrowers and perpetual positions may face liquidations when the Sequencer is down if the Chainlink Adaptor does not check the Sequencer Uptime Feed and have a Grace Period.

## Vulnerability Detail

On L2 platforms like Arbitrum, developers need to check the Sequencer Uptime when using Oracle Price Feeds. However, the `chainlinkAdaptor` contract does not implement the L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed and Grace Period.

        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

This is very risky and can have negative consequences for borrowers in JUSD and traders in JOJO system, as their calculations depend heavily on the Oracle. There may be mass liquidations when the Sequencer resumes. For more details, please refer to this article.

        Consider you have deployed a lending protocol on L2, and its sequencer goes down. This has happened in the past and may happen in the future. When the sequencer comes back online and oracles update their prices, all price movements that occurred during downtime are applied at once. If these movements are significant, they may cause chaos. Borrowers would rush to save their positions, while liquidators would rush to liquidate borrowers. Since liquidations are handled mainly by bots, borrowers are likely to suffer mass liquidations.

## Impact

Borrowers and traders may suffer losses or unfair gains due to significant price movements when the Sequencer comes back online.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check for L2 Sequencer Uptime and `GRACE_PERIOD_TIME` before getting the price from PriceFeed. For example:
