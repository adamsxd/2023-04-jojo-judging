# malicious traders can launch grieving attack by sending aggressive order off-chain and frontrun the on-chain matching with withdrawal

## Summary
malicious traders can launch grieving attack by intentionally sending aggressive order off-chain and frontrun the on-chain matching with withdrawal

## Vulnerability Detail
Since withdrawal request can be queued in advanced, malicious users can first :
1. queue a withdrawal request, 
2. deposit and wait until the the withdrawal lock passes
3. make an aggressive large taker order on the centralised backend
4. simultaneously frontrun the approveTrade by calling executeWithdraw
5. orderSender would then execute approveTrade first, then the tx would only revert at the `isAllSafe` check at the end of `trade`

```solidity
function trade(bytes calldata tradeData) external {
        (
            address[] memory traderList,
            int256[] memory paperChangeList,
            int256[] memory creditChangeList
        ) = IDealer(owner()).approveTrade(msg.sender, tradeData);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < traderList.length; ) {
            _settle(traderList[i], paperChangeList[i], creditChangeList[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        require(IDealer(owner()).isAllSafe(traderList), "TRADER_NOT_SAFE");
    }
```

## Impact
orderSender can waste lots of gas as a result of grieving
