# Bypass the withdraw period

## Summary
There is no asset transfers in the `JOJODealer.requestWithdraw()`, hence the withdraw period can be easily circumvented.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `requestWithdraw()` is used to request a withdrawal of the primary and secondary tokens from the contract with a specified time lock period.As this function does not involve any asset transfers, it can be easily circumvented. A bad actor can call this function in advance and then call `executeWithdraw()` at any time to withdraw the assets.
```solidity
function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }

```
