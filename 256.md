# Protocol may lose money as repay amount could be less than borrowed amount

## Summary
Protocol may lose money as repay amount could be less than borrowed amount

## Vulnerability Detail
Supposably, repay amount should cover the borrowed amount. Right now, repay amount could be less than borrowed amount.

See the following code in JUSDBank#_borrow,

```soildity
 uint256 t0Amount = tAmount.decimalRemainder(tRate)
            ? tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate)
            : tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate) + 1;
```

if a tAmount cannot fully divisible by 1, 1 is added

See the following code in JUSDBank#_repay,

```solidity            
tBorrowAmount = amount;
t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate); 
``` 

if amount cannot be fully divisible by 1, 1 is not added
           
## Impact
Protocol may lose dust which could be a significant amount after years because repay amount could be less than borrowed amount

## Recommendation
Change the following code

```solidity
function _repay(
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        address payer,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 tRate
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.REPAY_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        uint256 JUSDBorrowed = user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);
        uint256 tBorrowAmount;
        uint256 t0Amount;
        if (JUSDBorrowed <= amount) {
            tBorrowAmount = JUSDBorrowed;
            t0Amount = user.t0BorrowBalance;
        } else {
            tBorrowAmount = amount;
            --- t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate);
            +++   uint256 t0Amount = amount.decimalRemainder(tRate)
            +++ ? amount.decimalDiv(tRate)
            +++ : amount.decimalDiv(tRate) + 1;
        }
        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), tBorrowAmount);
        user.t0BorrowBalance -= t0Amount;
        t0TotalBorrowAmount -= t0Amount;
        emit Repay(payer, to, tBorrowAmount);
        return tBorrowAmount;
    }
```
