# Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability in Struct Balance Variables #LL77C9-L80C6

## Summary

The  vulnerability is related to an arithmetic `overflow/underflow` that can occur in a contract's code when computing the credit value
The contract stores the balances of traders in a struct that includes two` int128` variables, and when computing the credit value, the code performs an arithmetic operation that can result in a value larger than the maximum or smaller than the minimum value ` int256` variable,This can lead to unexpected behavior and can be exploited by attackers to steal funds or cause other types of damage.

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
function balanceOf(
        address trader
    ) external view returns (int256 paper, int256 credit) {
        paper = int256(balanceMap[trader].paper);
        credit =
            paper.decimalMul(fundingRate) +
            int256(balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit);
    }
```

this is vulnerable to to arithmetic `overflow/underflow` attacks
The contract defines a struct `balance ` to` store` the balances of each trader, which includes two` int128` variables: `paper` and `reducedCredit`
The `paper` variable `stores` the `paper amount`, which is a `1e18 `based `decimal`.
 The `reducedCredit` variable is used instead of the `credit` value itself, so that after the `funding `rate is updated, the credit values can be updated without any extra storage write.
when computing the credit value, the following line of code is used:

```solidity
credit =
            paper.decimalMul(fundingRate) +
            int256(balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit);
    }
```

This line is vulnerable to arithmetic` overflow/underflow` attacks, because the result of `paper.decimalMul(fundingRate)` can be larger than the maximum value of an `int256` variable or smaller than the minimum value of an` int256` variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can be exploited by attackers to steal funds or cause other types of damage.

## Impact

An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to steal funds or cause other types of damage to the contract. For instance, they can manipulate the funding rate to increase the credit value beyond the maximum limit, which can cause an arithmetic overflow/underflow and lead to unexpected behavior

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this  the contract should perform appropriate bounds checking and handle any possible arithmetic overflow/underflow conditions. For example, the contract can use the `SafeMath` library to perform arithmetic operations in a safe way
