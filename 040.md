# Changing the borrowFeeRate results in a lower than expectet borrowFeeRate for new borrowed JUSD

## Summary
If the JUSDBank changes the `borrowFeeRate`, the fee rate users are paying for borrowed JUSD is lower than the new `borrowFeeRate`

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets say the `borrowFeeRate` is 2% (2e16) and after a year the bank decides to change the borrowFeeRate to 1% (1e16). For this they call the function `jusdBank.updateBorrowFeeRate()`. This function sets the `lastUpdateTimestamp` to the current `block.timestamp` and sets the `t0Rate` to the current `TRate`. 
After one year the `TRate` is `1020000000000000000`. This means, when updating the `borrowFeeRate`, ` t0Rate` is set to `1020000000000000000`. 

## Impact

After changing the  `borrowFeeRate` after one year from 2% to 1%,  a user borrows 100 JUSD. When repaying this 100 JUSD after 1 year, the bank would expect to get 101 JUSD but since the base of the borrowing fee calculation (` t0Rate`) is no longer 1 but 1,02 the repayment amount for 100 JUSD after one year is only 100.980392 JUSD instead of 101 JUSD. This leads to a nearly 2% lost of borrowing fee income for the bank. This effect gets even worse with each change of the borrowFeeRate since the base of the borrowing fee calculation (` t0Rate`) becomes bigger each time. Over time this effect will lead to millions of JUSD in borrowing fee less paid to the bank.

## Recommendation

To make sure the fees received by the bank match the `borrowFeeRate`, the base of the fee calculation (` t0Rate`)  for JUSD borrowed after changing should be adjusted so it is 1 at the time of borrowing. This could be done by creating an array of loans for each user where each loan includes the block.timestamp when the laon was initiated, the loan amount and an adjustment factor that modifies the ` t0Rate` so it is 1 at the time the loan was given. Eg. for the example above:

struct Loan{
uint256 amount; //eg. 100
uint256 timeBorrowed; // eg.  time loan was given
uint256 t0RateAndjustment // eg. `tRate when loan was given - 1`
}

For calculating the BorrowBalance one would need to loop over the array of loans and

- calculate the borrowBalance for each loan using `timeBorrowed` instead of `lastUpdateTimestamp` and adjusting the current tRate buy `t0RateAndjustment `
