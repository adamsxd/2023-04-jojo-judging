# If usdc depegs and falls  to 0 then the oralce will revert

## Summary
Usdc can depeg and when it does the Oracle will revert, do to division by 0 
## Vulnerability Detail
Even if usdc falls it should still accept its input of whatever the   real price at the current time the oracle is called
When the price falls it can be  0 and when that happens the function will revert and then the price cant be reached and the oracle won't work, which it still should accept a price of 0 if that is the real spot price of usdc.
## Impact
dos
## Code Snippet
```solidity
uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend, letting the price go to zero or having a check that if 0  is the price of usdc  then it gets back 0 or having  pause functionality on the protocol
