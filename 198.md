# no check wether arrays are equal

## Summary
there is no check whether arrays are equal
## Vulnerability Detail
in updateFundingRate the owner provides two arrays, `perpList` and `rateList`. the two should be equal in length however that cannot be ascertained as there is no check for that
## Impact
the function will revert if the arrays arent equal in length
