# Insurance account’s bad debt can be cleared

## Summary
Due to the lack of checks in calling `handleBadDebt`, bad debts in insurance accounts can be cleared.
## Vulnerability Detail
`handleDebt` can be directly called externally without permission check.
https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/main/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol#L56
```solidity
function handleBadDebt(address liquidatedTrader) external {
        Liquidation.handleBadDebt(state, liquidatedTrader);
}
```

As bad debts are taken over by the insurance account in `handleBadDebt`, the insurance account meets the condition of `!_isSafe`. And since the insurance account does not participate in transactions, `openPosition` is also 0, thus meeting the requirements of `handleBadDebt`.
https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/main/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L402
```solidity
function handleBadDebt(Types.State storage state, address liquidatedTrader)
        external
    {
        if (
            state.openPositions[liquidatedTrader].length == 0 &&
            !Liquidation._isSafe(state, liquidatedTrader)
        )
```

In handleDebt, the credit of the target account will be cleared to zero at the end, so bad debts of insurance are also cleared.
```solidity
state.primaryCredit[state.insurance] += primaryCredit;
state.secondaryCredit[state.insurance] += secondaryCredit;
state.primaryCredit[liquidatedTrader] = 0; // @audit liquidatedTrader == state.insurance
state.secondaryCredit[liquidatedTrader] = 0;
```

You can update `test/liquidation-test.ts` as follows to perform the test.
```diff

## Impact
The bad debt data has been cleared, so it is impossible to know the true economic situation of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `handleBadDebt` in JOJOExternal needs to add permission control and does not allow the insurance address as a parameter.
