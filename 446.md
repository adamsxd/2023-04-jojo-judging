# Users can deposited delisted assets

## Summary

Internal withdraws have missing checks. This lets users deposit blacklisted assets, bypassing a check.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `withdraw` has a flag `isInternal` which determines if the withdraw goes out to a user, or into another account of the same contract. This function essentially deposits to another account, if `isInternal` is set to true. The deposit mechanism however does not have all of the logic checks which are present in the raw `deposit` function. This lets users bypass certain checks related to blacklisted assets, and allows them to deposit them as long as they are transferring it from another account with the contract.

The function `withdraw` has the following checks for internal transfers:

The deposit function itself also has a set of checks.

In the first case, the check in the deposit function which checks if the asset is allowed or not is missing.

```solidity
require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
```

Thus users can increase the deposit balance of their dis-allowed tokens by using this mechanism.

## Impact

Disallowed tokens can still be deposited.
