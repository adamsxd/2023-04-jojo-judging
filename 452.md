# `markPrice` decimals are expected in several instances to be 18 but are 6 instead

## Summary

There are several instances where calculations expect `markPrice` to be in 18 decimals, but `markPrice` is in 6 decimals instead.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are several instances in the codebase where the decimals of `markPrice` changes from 18 to 6:

Comments pertaining to `markPrice` indicate decimals of 18:
- [`markPrice` in `IDealer.sol`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/intf/IDealer.sol#L123)
- [`markPrice` in `IMarkPriceSource.sol`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/intf/IMarkPriceSource.sol#L10)

Tests involving `markPrice` swap between using 18 decimals and 6:
- [test using `markPrice` with 6 decimals](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/test/decimal6-test.ts#L40-L42)
- [test using `markPrice` with 18 decimals](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/test/liquidation-test.ts#L121)

Most importantly, all [decimal multiplication](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/utils/SignedDecimalMath.sol#L10-L14) is done with a denominator whose value is fixed at `10**18`. However, on the Arbitrum Goerli testnet, JOJO returns `markPrice` with 6 decimals.

## Impact

`markPrice` is typically multiplied with `paperAmount` to calculate `netPositionValue`, `exposure`, and the `maintenanceMargin` for traders. However, because `decimalMul` divides the product of `markPrice` and `paperAmount` with a fixed value of `10**18`, any product of `paperAmount` and `markPrice` such that the magnitude of the result is less than `10**18` will cause division truncation which will return 0. Returning 0 for non-zero values of `paperAmount` and `markPrice` is incorrect, and can cause functions like [`getTotalExposure`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L53), [`_isAllSafe`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L129), etc. to return incorrect results and/or tabulate incorrect balances for traders.

Additionally, switching between 6 and 18 decimals further increases the chance of accidentally setting `markPrice` with the wrong scaling. This increases the risk of integrations with JOJO anticipating the wrong scaling for price, which could under-value or over-value a user's position and deposited credit. Finally, a majority of testing is done with `markPrice` in 18 decimals, but on-chain `markPrice` is most likely going to be in 6 decimals. This provides poor test coverage and could be masking issues.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
int256 constant SignedONE = 10**18;
function decimalMul(int256 a, int256 b) internal pure returns (int256) {
    return (a * b) / SignedONE;
}
function decimalDiv(int256 a, int256 b) internal pure returns (int256) {
    return (a * SignedONE) / b;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

Consider updating tests and comments to consistently use either 18 or 6 decimals. For multiplication and division that uses a fixed value of `10**18`, consider adding a parameter to specify the magnitude to scale by so that the correct scaling can be used in different calculations. If JOJO does not wish to change the math scaling, then consider requiring a minimum trade and deposit `paperAmount` such that `paperAmount * markPrice >= 10**18`.
