# maxTotalBorrowAmount can be bypassed.

## Summary
the maximum amount the platform can lend out can be bypassed
## Vulnerability Detail
maxTotalBorrowAmount is a value that shows how much users on the platform can borrow, once this value is reached no more borrowing should take place, however that isnt the case, the check on whether the ceiling have been reached on borrowing happens after the funds have been sent to users. 
## Impact
the platform will lend out more than they should
