# [M-01] Missed check for decimals in buyJUSD() function can leads to loss.

## Summary
SC: JUSDExchange.sol

Due to the fact that `src/token/JUSD.sol` has not hard-coded decimals or decimals value was not disclosed in contest description I think this should be valid.

Function `buyJUSD()` missed `require (IERC20(JUSD).decimals() == IERC20(primaryAsset).decimals(), "different decimals) or integrated special library decimals-converter.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's assume user want  buy 100 JUSD by 100 USDC.
If JUSD would be deployed with 8 decimals, final result will we this:
1) User transferred 100_000000 USDC
2) User received 1_00000000 JUSD, what is actual equal 1 JUSD.

## Impact
User or JUSDExchange contract could lost funds.
