# Missing input validation in Perpetual.sol

## Summary

The trade function in Perpetual.sol lacks proper input validation, which may lead to unexpected behavior or potential security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the trade function, the contract does not validate the length of the traderList, paperChangeList, and creditChangeList. This can lead to potential inconsistencies or unexpected behavior if the input arrays are of unequal length or if they are empty.

## Impact

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by providing input arrays of unequal length or with empty arrays, which may lead to unexpected behavior and could potentially harm the contract's integrity.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation checks for the length of the traderList, paperChangeList, and creditChangeList to ensure they are equal and non-empty.
