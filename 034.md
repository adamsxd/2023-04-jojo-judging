# Missing check for equal array lengths in `approveTrade`

## Summary

The arrays `orderList`, `signatureList` & `matchPaperAmount` are missing checks to ensure they are of the same length after being decoded from the input bytes. This may lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `approveTrade` the registered perp is supplies the `tradeData` which is of type `bytes calldata`. This is then decoded to form 3 arrays, `orderList`, `signatureList` & `matchPaperAmount`, which are then iterated over to validate them.

The issue is that no sanity check ensures these decoded arrays are the same length.

## Impact

The loop, in which the arrays are iterated over, performs signature verification & if the `signatureList` array is missing signatures this could have unexpected consequences such as potentially allowing a malformed trade to be approved.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check to ensure the lengths match:

```solidity
require(orderList.length == signatureList.length, Errors.INVALID_LENGTH);
require(orderList.length == matchPaperAmount.length, Errors.INVALID_LENGTH);
```
