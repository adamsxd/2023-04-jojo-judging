# If `Trate` is greater then `amount` when the user repays the funds wont be repayed

## Summary
Since of rounding error when `Trate` is more than the user requested it will turn into 0 and nothing will get repaid but the user will  send a small amount of funds
## Vulnerability Detail
ex:
Alice wants to repay 1 wei for its loan but `Trate=1e19` so when `1e18/1e19=0` so it will subtract 0 and the `transferFrom` will transfer the 1 wei to the contract.
## Impact
small loss of funds but with a bigger `Trate`  it have bigger rounding error
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 } else {
            tBorrowAmount = amount;
            t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate);
        }
        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), tBorrowAmount);
        user.t0BorrowBalance -= t0Amount;
        t0TotalBorrowAmount -= t0Amount;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check that  if `t0Amount` is 0 that is reverts
