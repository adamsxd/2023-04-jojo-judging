# DoS risk if enough positions are open

## Summary
DoS risk if enough positions are open

## Vulnerability Detail
If `state.openPositions[trader]` is big enough `_realizePnl()` might be blocked.

## Impact
In `_realizePnl()` in `Position.sol` there is a for loop which iterates through all open positions of the trader. The issue is that if the trader has too many open positions `_realizePnl()` may not be able to be called due to the block gas limit.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Position.sol#L22-L41
```solidity
 address[] storage positionList = state.openPositions[trader];
 for (uint256 i = 0; i < positionList.length;) {
     if (positionList[i] == msg.sender) {
         positionList[i] = positionList[positionList.length - 1];
         positionList.pop();
         break;
     }
     unchecked {
         ++i;
     }
 }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a mapping instead of an array for the open positions
