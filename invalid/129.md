# fee on transfer tokens not handled

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

## Summary

JOJO protocol doesn't support the tokens that have fee on transfer and this may cause the protocol face some problem in future, for now the protocol decided to not work with tokens that have fee on transfer but, as the protocol team/sponser mentioned that they will add more tokens as collateral and the protocol will work with more token than now, and the team planning to deploy the protocol on other L2 blockchain, there is many token that did not charge fee on transfer in some blockchain but it use fee on other blockchains (example USDT) same case may happen to USDC and other token that may charge fee on transfer in other blockchains in future. (i talked with the sponser in the server and they said that they're planning to add more collateral and deploying the jojo protocol on other blockchain)

## Vulnerability Detail

the protocol did not support token that have fee on transfer this may cause the protocol some problem, one example for that :

1-imagine Alice want to depoist 100 tokens(as collateral) by calling a deposit function in the protocol :

```solidity

 function _deposit(
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve,
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from
    ) internal {
        require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);
        user.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
        reserve.totalDepositAmount += amount;

        ...
```

2- the token have fee on transfer %5 and the the protocol add only 95 token as collateral to alice balance in this case

3- then alice want to deposit all his 100 tokens but the transaction will fail because alice want to deposit 100 token but she only have 95 token in her balance.

the token here is example it could be any token that would be added in future that have fee on trasnfer or at least have fee on other blockchains

## Impact

the protocol didn't handle token that have fee on transfer, this may cause problem in future if the available tokens in protocol add fee on transfer on arbitrum or in other blockchains or the protocol adding any other token that charge fee now or in future

## Tool used

manual review

## Recommendation

add a check to the balance that the user send before and after the transfer of tokens in all the functions that transfer tokens and add the balance after tx as collateral of the user , example for that :

```solidity
balanceBefore = IERC20(collateral).balanceOf(user)
IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount)
balanceAfter = IERC20(collateral).balanceOf(user)

```
