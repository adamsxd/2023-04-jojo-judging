# Missing input validation in deposit function

## Summary

The deposit function in Funding.sol does not perform input validation for the to address. This could lead to a potential loss of funds if an invalid address is provided.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the deposit function of Funding.sol, the to parameter is not validated. A user could unintentionally or maliciously provide an invalid address (e.g., the zero address), which would result in the deposited funds being irretrievable.

## Impact

Funds deposited to an invalid address will be permanently locked and inaccessible to the intended recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add input validation to check for the validity of the to address in the deposit function. For example, ensure that the provided address is not the zero address:

```solidity
require(to != address(0), "Invalid address");
```
