# `getMaxChange` can exceed `speedMultiplier*liquidationThreshold`

## Summary
The max change is supposed to provide the upperbound for the funding rate change rate, which is supposed to not exceed `speedMultiplier*liquidationThreshold`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If the last updated time is > 1 day, the value can exceed what's intended.

## Impact
The code may not behave as described.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Cap the `timeInteval` to a maximum of 1 day to ensure the potential loophole is mitigated.
