# Renouncing ownership or admin role could completely break the operation of protocol used in perpetual.sol, FundingRateUpdateLimiter.sol even mint and burn in the JUSD token will be inaccessible

## Summary

Complete inaccessibility to all `onlyOwner()` operations, literally meaning that the whole protocol is broken, which could better be resolved by removing the

## Vulnerability Detail

Multiple contracts in scope inherit the OpenZeppelin’s Ownable.sol cpntract, now as stated by team owner is trusted, and the contract’s owner is the account that deploys the contract. As a result, the owner is able to perform certain privileged activities.

The OpenZeppelin’s Ownable used in this project contract implements renounceOwnership. This can represent a certain risk if the ownership is renounced for any other reason than by design.
Renouncing ownership will leave the contract without an owner, thereby removing all functionalitis that is only available to the owner.
