# It is hard to execute deposit or repay function in JUSDMulticall#multiCall

## Summary
It is hard to execute deposit or repay function in JUSDMulticall#multiCall

## Vulnerability Detail
Multicall is able to execute 1 or more function calls in a single transaction.  Looking at other getter methods in the JUSDMulticall. User can perform multiple recommended function calls which involve

- multiCall
- deposit
- borrow
- repay
- setOperator
- withdraw

However, It is hard for caller to perform activities which involve deposit or repay functions because both functions have ```safeTransferFrom``` (See the code in codeSnippet section) which needs approval to be called. 

Technically, it is still possible to execute both function provided the caller know what is the calldata bytes to create the allowance. 

But deposit caller which is the operator (See the following code)

```solidity
    function deposit(
        address from,
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant **isValidOperator**(msg.sender, from) {
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve = reserveInfo[collateral];
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        //        deposit
        _deposit(reserve, user, amount, collateral, to, from);
    }
```

and repay caller which is any random user (See the following code)

```solidity
function repay(
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        return _repay(user, msg.sender, to, amount, tRate);
    }
```

may not have the necessary knowledge to create the approval call data

## Impact
It is very likely that deposit or repay function cannot be multicalled due to zero allowance

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Add a function that consist of asset, approvalTarget and amount parameters
2. Add the following code => ```IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);``` to the function
3. Add another function that create bytes to call the function

With the 2 functions, user can easily create allowance before calling deposit or repay in a multicalls
