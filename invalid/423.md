# JOJOExternal.approveTrade could be blocked by sending incorrect values

## Summary
When sending a trade off-chain, if one of the requirements values (which are checked on-chain) are incorrect, `approveTrade` will always fail leading to DoS
## Vulnerability Detail
How the trade are exactly matched off-chain or what kind of data is gathered and send off-chain (and how) is unclear.
So assuming the user has the possibility to send all data that is within `tradeData`

Assuming above, it's possible to send multiple trades off-chain with incorrect data to prevent from other trades happening.
E.g. a user submits a trade off-chain where, in `tradeDate`, `order.perp` does not equal the Perpetual.sol address which leads to failing of the `approveTrade` function.

Also assuming (and a bit according to the docs), when orders are send from off-chain to on-chain, the off-chain sets those order in pause or even temporary removes them.
By sending multiple trades with incorrect values, a lot of trades could be blocked for a period of time.
## Impact
Multiple trades could be blocked for a period of time

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A recommendation on this is hard since a big part of this is handled off-chain without insight of it
