# Max Deposits per account can be sidestepped

## Summary

`_maxDepositAmountPerAccount` is a value used to cap deposits, however EOAs and Contract Wallets are extremely cheap to produce, meaning that the cap is not truly enforceable


## Vulnerability Detail

`_maxDepositAmountPerAccount` enforces that each account is limited, but because we can create multiple accounts, even in the same tx, the cap doesn't really offer any protection.

The cap can be easily sidestepped by either creating multiple Smart Contract wallets or by using multiple EOAs


## Impact

`_maxDepositAmountPerAccount` is easily sidestepped by the same actor


## Code Snippet

```solidity
        reserveInfo[collateral]
            .maxDepositAmountPerAccount = _maxDepositAmountPerAccount;
        reserveInfo[collateral]
            .maxColBorrowPerAccount = _maxColBorrowPerAccount;
```

Because it's free to create new EOAs, these checks will not offer protection in practice

Even during a Flashloan, new contracts can be cheaply deployed via proxies, making these limitation ineffective

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the check and only use max value, or consider limiting per hour
