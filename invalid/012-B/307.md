# Second Oracle Price Sanity Check Missing Wrong Price Likely Passes

## Summary
Missing second oracle price sanity check in JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol might directly pass wrong prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
In JUSD, there are two oracle price adaptor contracts-JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol and UniswapPriceAdaptor.sol. In UniswapPriceAdaptor.sol `getAssetPrice()` , uniswapPriceFeed is compared with EmergencyOracle price to check for deviation before returning the value. 
```solidity
//UniswapPriceAdaptor.sol
 require(
            (diff * 1e18) / JOJOPriceFeed <= impact,
            "deviation is too big"
        ); 
        return uniswapPriceFeed;
```
However, in JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol `getAssetPrice()`, no such secondary oracle price check is enforced. Chainlink Oracle price is only checked for freshness before returning the value. The missing check opens up opportunity for exploit in situations where chainlink reports a price different from the market price.
```solidity
//JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol
 uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) /
            SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return (tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE) / decimalsCorrection; 
```
Although uncommon, chainlink reported wrong prices before. As an example, ChainlinkAdapterOracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer. In a drastic token crash like LUNA crash, chainlink continually reported a preset min price much higher than actual token value causing over inflated collateral valuation leading to large scale exploits of protocols with naive oracle implementation. During similar incidents, current implementation of `getAssetPrice()` in JOJOracleAdaptor.sol would allow bad prices to inflate collateral values.

Even though manual fixes can be done to replace oracle adaptor address in such incident, it's likely not prompt to prevent early financial loss due to over borrowing against inflated collaterals, which when executed at a large scale could quickly result insolvency of the protocol.
## Impact
In extreme conditions, wrong prices are likely passed to inflate collateral values resulting in over borrowing. The protocol might be at risk of insolvency. Manual fixes under such circumstance are unlikely to prevent early financial losses for the protocol.

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

## Recommendation
Add a secondary oracle price check in `getAssetPrice()`.
