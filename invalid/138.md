# The approveTrade() won't revert on expired orders

## Summary
The approve trade isn't supposed to approve expired orders 

## Vulnerability Detail
The approveTrade() uses a faulty check to check against expired orders. 

Now this check will allow expired orders to be approved also.

```solidity
            require(
                Trading._info2Expiration(order.info) >= block.timestamp,
                Errors.ORDER_EXPIRED
            );
```

The problem here within the require statement check is that it allows the returned `uint256 expiration` from `_info2Expiration()` to be `>` block.timestamp. 

That means expired orders can be approved as well by the approveTrade() function.
 
## Impact
Expired orders can be approved by the approveTrade() function.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
repair the require statement check by removing the `>`  sign and replacing it with the `<` sign
```solidity
            require(
                Trading._info2Expiration(order.info) <= block.timestamp,
                Errors.ORDER_EXPIRED
            );
```
