# setPerpRiskParams can be blocked

## Summary
DoS risk if there are enough registered perps

## Vulnerability Detail
In `setPerpRiskParams()` there is a for loop that loops through all registered perps. At some point there will be too many registered perps and going through the entire array will be impossible because `setPerpRiskParams()` may not be able to be called due to the block gas limit.

## Impact
In this scenario registering new perps and changing perp risk params will be blocked.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using a mapping instead of an array for the registered perps
