# JUSDOperation contract initReserve() can be called multiple times with same address

## Summary
JUSDOperation's initReserve function can be called multiple times with same collateral address causing the values of reserveInfo to be overridden with new values. The init function is not prevent reinitialization.

Every time the call is made, the same collateral address is pushed to reservesList.
The reservesNum is also incremented every time initReserve() is called.
This will continue until the maxReservesNum state variable is hit.

After that until maxReservesNum is updated, new reserves cannot be added.
The only line of defence is the onlyOwner modifier. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Same collateral can be pushed multiple times into the reservesList. After that there is no provision to reset the reservesList array that is returned by function getReservesList(). This is a permanent list.

reservesNum is also incremented and that also cannot be reset as there is no provision to do so.

maxReservesNum can be further updated to upper or lower number with out any consideration to reservesList and reservesNum.

updateMaxReservesAmount() changes the maxReservesNum state variable with out consideration to reservesNum or reservesList.
The updateMaxReservesAmount() can set maxReservesNum to a lower number that reservesNum as there is no check.

## Impact
The JUSDBankStorage has information that is not synching maxReservesNum with reservesNum and reservesList

There is no way to correct this with the current implementation.

In the viewer, the getReservelist() will return duplicate values.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In JUSDOperation, keep a mapping for collateral to initialization status, so that reserve is initialized only once.
in JUSDBankStorage, add a new mapping
 mapping(address => bool) public initializedReserves

In the initReserve, 
before intializing a reserve, check if
require(!initializedReserves[_collateral]);

after initializing, flag the collateral as true
initializedReserves[_collateral]= true

This way, the list of reserves returned and kept is storage can be unqiue and will remain in sync.
