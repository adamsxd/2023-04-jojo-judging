# Flashloan function is not capable of performing a flashloan

## Summary
It's not possible to perform a flashloan with JUSDBank.flashLoan since it's only possible to receive already deposited collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
The flashloan function has three actions:
- call `_withdraw` to received desired amount
- call `JOJOFlashLoan` function on user specified contract in order to pay back the amount
- call `_isAccountSafe` to ensure account has returned enough collateral

These functions are indeed the backbone of performing a flashloan (borrow without collateral, return it in the same transaction).
Only the problem is that `_withdraw` has the following check 
`require(
            amount <= fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral],
            JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_TOO_BIG
        );`
Meaning you can only withdraw what you've already deposited, making it the same as the `withdraw` function.
## Impact
flashLoan function does not function as it should.
