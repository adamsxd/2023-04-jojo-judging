# The `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` could fail silently.

## Summary
The `safeTransferFrom` and `safeTransfer` could fail silently, which can cause issues with deposit and maintaining correct balances.

## Vulnerability Detail
Take this code for example, where `safeTransferFrom` return a boolean value which is not checked.

```solidity
function deposit(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount,
        address to
    ) external {
        //!! Return value of safeTransferFrom is not checked.
        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                primaryAmount
            );
            state.primaryCredit[to] += SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
        }
        if (secondaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                secondaryAmount
            );
            state.secondaryCredit[to] += secondaryAmount;
        }
        emit Deposit(to, msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
    }
```

which could easily be be checked with :
```solidity
bool success = IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                secondaryAmount
            );
require(success, "Transfer failed")
```

## Impact
Protocol suffers from loss funds, but credits the user's balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do this instead:

```solidity
bool success = IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                secondaryAmount
            );
require(success, "Transfer failed")
```
