# It's possible to perform a flashloan which also exceeds max values

## Summary
It's possible to perform a flashloan which exceeds the max borrow values
## Vulnerability Detail
1. `JUSDBank.borrow` calls `_borrow` before `__isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` which checks if user is able to borrow specified amount. 
This creates the possibility to perform a flashloan via the following way:
- Create a contract with functionalities to perform the flashloan
- Call `borrow` with a high amount which get received when `_borrow -> (JUSD)safeTransfer` is performed
- On receive, call `JUSDBank.repay` and repay loan
- `__isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` is called after all this is executed and will pass

2. `_borrow` only checks if balances do not exceed `maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` and `maxTotalBorrowAmount` after the transfer has made. This makes is possible to perform the flashloan with all the JUSD that is available.
## Impact
