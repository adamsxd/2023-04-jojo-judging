# You can only flashLoan up to what you deposited, making levering up more costly

## Summary

Flashloan allows to borrow only up to the amount of collateral deposited, preventing the ability to lever up in one tx

## Vulnerability Detail

Levering up on JUSD would look like the following:
- Deposit Collateral
- Borrow JUSD
- Buy Collateral with JUSD
- Repeat

This can be computed offChain and via a flashLoan multiple loops can be performed in one go via:

- Compute total Deposited and total Borrowed
- Transfer initial amount
- Flashloan final deposited amount, deposit it
- Borrow the rest, sell it and repay the Flashloan with it
- Sweep remaining tokens to caller


## Impact

The additional gas cost of levering up will make it less likely for small accounts to do so
