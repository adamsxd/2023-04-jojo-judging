# Trader might experience drastic loss due to slippage at the time of on-chain order approval

## Summary
Trader may experience drastic loss at the point of order on-chain execution due to slippage.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Jojo system, long and short orders were matched off-chain before submitting on-chain for execution and approval. This opens up the issue of delay between long/short order placement time by a trader, and the final on-chain execution when markPrice is assessed to verify netValue is safe.

The delay is partially limited by the original order info submitted by a long/short trader where an order expiration time is required as input. Because of the off-chain matching and on-chain execution process, there needs to be minimal time allowed to account for system matching and  on-chain order relaying. Note that in JOJO's unit test environment, this expiration is input as 1000s. (order.ts)

```solidity
//JOJOExternal.sol-approveTrade()
            require(
                Trading._info2Expiration(order.info) >= block.timestamp, ////!!!note: not sure if _info2Expiration work exactly as intended! Need to look into it
                Errors.ORDER_EXPIRED
            );

```
```solidity
//Types.sol -expiration built into bytes32 info
struct Order {
...
            ╔═══════════════════╤═════════╗
            ║ info component    │ type    ║
            ╟───────────────────┼─────────╢
            ║ makerFeeRate      │ int64   ║
            ║ takerFeeRate      │ int64   ║
            ║ expiration        │ uint64  ║
            ║ nonce             │ uint64  ║
            ╚═══════════════════╧═════════╝
        bytes32 info;
    }
```

If 1000s is a good reference as a maximum allowable delay, one can argue that in some case, the actual time gap could approach this number and this means that dramatic price swing within a set order expiration time could happen which results in the netValue loss for a trader. 

However, there is no on-chain checks to account for the possible slippage scenario. If a trader at the time of order approval resulted in a drastic loss in netValue, when a trader has sufficient deposit as collateral, the order will still pass and verified. The trader will be left with great loss in their netValue, more vulnerable to liquidation.

```solidity
//Liquidaation.sol - isAllSafe()
...
int256 netValue = state.primaryCredit[trader] +
                SafeCast.toInt256(state.secondaryCredit[trader]);
...
 maintenanceMargin +=
                    (paperAmount.decimalMul(markPrice).abs() *
                        params.liquidationThreshold) /
                    Types.ONE;
                netValue += paperAmount.decimalMul(markPrice) + credit;
```
In the above check, a trader can be still safe with negative netValue as the result of a unfavorable markPrice as long as they have enough deposits.

## Impact

A trader could finish a trade with a drastic loss making them dangerously close to liquidation.  And the protocol is at risk of acquiring bad debts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider add a stop price in order info struct and revert order approval when stop price is reached during on-chain execution.
