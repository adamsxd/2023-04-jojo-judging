# Lack of access to oracle price due to unhandled chainlink revert

## Summary
Call to `latestRoundData` chainlink function could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. The `latestRoundData` call need to be surrounded in a try/catch block.

## Vulnerability Detail
chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidity's try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.
Refer to https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ for more information regarding potential risks to account for when relying on external price feed providers.

## Impact
The call to `latestRoundData` could potentially revert, causing Denial of Service.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Surround the call to latestRoundData() with try/catch instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
