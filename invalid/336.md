# FundingRateUpdateLimiter.updateFundingRate() could malfunction due to the absence of array length check and uninitialized fundingRateUpdateTimestamp

## Summary
FundingRateUpdateLimiter.updateFundingRate() could behave unexpectedly on:
1. `perpList.length != rateList.length`, and/or
2.  the first call when `fundingRateUpdateTimestamp` is still uninitialized, i.e. defaulted to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
This function assumes that the `perpList` and `rateList` arrays are of the same length. However, there is no explicit check in place to enforce this. Here are some potential consequences:

1. If `perpList` is longer than `rateList`, the function could try to access an index in the shorter `rateList` that doesn't exist, which would cause a runtime error and revert the transaction due to an invalid opcode. 
2. If `rateList` is longer than `perpList`, the loop will stop when it reaches the end of the shorter `perpList`. In this case, some funding rates in `rateList` will be ignored, which could lead to the incorrect perception that all perpetual contracts have been updated with the new rates.

Although the array lengths are later checked in [`Operation.updateFundingRate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L81-L84) when invoked by `JOJOOperation.updateFundingRate()` that is callable only by the funding rate keeper, it may be too late to do it. 

Additionally, [`fundingRateUpdateTimestamp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/fundingRateKeeper/FundingRateUpdateLimiter.sol#L30) is a mapping from a `perp` address to `timestamp`, but it is not explicitly initialized for any address. This could potentially cause issues if `getMaxChange()` is called for an address that has not yet had its funding rate updated in the first call. In Solidity, if you try to access a mapping with a key that does not exist, it will simply return the default value (0 for integers). This could lead to inaccurate calculations in `getMaxChange()` where the `timeInterval` would be equal to the `block.timestamp`, potentially leading to an unexpectedly large `maxChangeRate`.

## Impact
Here are the two corresponding impacts:
1. `perpList` and `rateList` could lead to unintended behavior or incorrect updates.
2. The require statement that checks if the difference between the new and old funding rates is within the acceptable limit will likely pass, even if the actual change is significant assuming that the very first `fundingRate` has been self initialized by the contract owner of Perpetual.sol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a require statement at the beginning of `updateFundingRate()` to ensure that the lengths of `perpList` and `rateList` are the same. Here's an example of how you can implement this:

```solidity
function updateFundingRate(address[] memory perpList, int256[] memory rateList) external onlyOwner {
    // Ensure perpList and rateList are of the same length
    require(perpList.length == rateList.length, "PerpList and rateList must have the same length");

    // Rest of the code as it was before
    ...
}
```
Adding this require statement will ensure that the function only proceeds when the lengths of perpList and rateList match, avoiding potential unintended consequences.

Consider also adding in `getMaxChange()` a condition to check if the `fundingRateUpdateTimestamp[perp]` value is zero, and if so, set an initial limit for the funding rate change :

```solidity
function getMaxChange(address perp) public view returns (uint256) {
    Types.RiskParams memory params = IDealer(dealer).getRiskParams(perp);
    uint256 markPrice = IMarkPriceSource(params.markPriceSource).getMarkPrice();
    
    // Check if it's the first update
    if (fundingRateUpdateTimestamp[perp] == 0) {
        // Set an initial limit for the funding rate change
        uint256 initialMaxChange = ...; // Define an appropriate value
        return initialMaxChange;
    }

    uint256 timeInterval = block.timestamp - fundingRateUpdateTimestamp[perp];
    uint256 maxChangeRate = (speedMultiplier * timeInterval * params.liquidationThreshold) / (1 days);
    uint256 maxChange = (maxChangeRate * markPrice) / Types.ONE;
    return maxChange;
}
```
By adding this condition, you can set an initial limit for the funding rate change during the first call to the updateFundingRate function, preventing unexpected behavior.
