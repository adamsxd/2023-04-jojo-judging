# User can steal JUSD and cheat system by repaying borrowed JUSD when `tRate` reduces

## Summary
Due to the possibility of tRate being reduced when admin calls `updateBorrowFeeRate()`, A user can repay less JUSD than the amount he initially borrowed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the getTRate function:

```solidity
function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp); // time since last updated, usually constructor timestamp
    return
        t0Rate +
        (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
        JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
}
```

This shows that tRate could be lowered if borrowFeeRate or timeDifference reduces, and timeDifference will always be reset to 0 each time admin `updateBorrowFeeRate()`, while borrowRate could directly be reduced by the admin.

A user can exploit this by borrowing an amount of JUSD, and repay immediately admin updates the borrowFeeRate, when he knows that tRate is lower than the amount it was when he borrowed the funds.

Malicious user could frontrun `updateBorrowFeeRate` with a `borrow` call, and backrun the `updateBorrowFeeRate` call with a `repay` call to maximize his profit.

Consider this scenario:

- Initial t0Rate set during initialization is 5, and borrowRate is 2
- after 182 days, tRate has increased to 5+(2 * (182 * 24 * 60 * 60)/(365 * 24 * 60 * 60))=6
- admin decides to increase the borrowFeeRate to 3, so Alice quickly borrows 60JUSD at tRate of 6, therefore, Alice's t0BorrowBalance is 60/6=10.
- Once the admin's `updateBorrowFeeRate` transaction gets executed, tRate is now 5+(3 * 1/(365 * 24 * 60 * 60))=5
- Alice repays her loan (which is calculated as t0BorrowBalance * tRate) at tRate of 5, which means she would only have to pay 10*5=50 JUSD
- Alice has now gained 60-50=10 JUSD

The higher the difference between getTRate() and t0Rate when borrowing, the higher the profit ; and the lower the difference between getTRate() and t0Rate while repaying, the higher the profit Alice would make.

Therefore, for Alice to maximize her profit,

- while borrowing, the time that has passed since `lastUpdateTime` should be as large as possible
- while repaying, the time that has passed since `lastUpdateTime` should be as little as possible.


## Impact
Malicious user could frontrun `updateBorrowFeeRate()` by borrowing huge amount of JUSD, and repay his loan by backrunning the `updateBorrowFeeRate()` call, to steal large amount of JUSD

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The main parameter that allows this attack is the reduction in `getTRate()` due to the reduction in `timeDifference`(`block.timestamp-lastUpdateTime`) whenever admin calls the `updateBorrowFeeRate()` function. So I recommend `lastUpdateTimestamp` should only be set in the constructor, and should not be updated when admin updates the borrowFeeRate.
