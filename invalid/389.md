# Incentive to self liquidate

## Summary

Although the contract disallow liquidation from the same address, the user can bypass it with another wallet in control. The key to prevent users from doing self liquidation is to make it not profitable for traders.


## Vulnerability Detail

The trader will have incentive to use another wallet to do a self liquidation as long as the price offset is not less than the insurance fee.

Take the numbers from the test file as example:
> AR  5x  
>  3% price offset 2% insurance 

For a position of 1,000 AR at the price of 10, when liquidated, the difference in price offset and insurance fee is 3% - 2% = 1%, 1,000 * 1% = 10 AR, around $100. 

Even the price offset is the same value as insurance fee, there is still a little profit for self liquidation, since in `Liquidation.sol#getLiquidateCreditAmount()`, `liqtorCreditChange` is calculated first, and used as the base amount for `insuranceFee` calculation. With the above example, assuming the insurance fee is increased to 3%, 1,000 AR, after price offset discount, credit change is 97% * 1,000 * 10 = 9,700. A discount of 300. 
`insuranceFee` is 9,700 * 3% = 291.
The self liquidation will profit for 300 - 291 = 9, due to the discounted base amount for insurance fee.

```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol
318:         liqtorCreditChange =
319:             -1 *
320:             liqtorPaperChange.decimalMul(SafeCast.toInt256(price));
321:         insuranceFee =
322:             (liqtorCreditChange.abs() * params.insuranceFeeRate) /
323:             Types.ONE;
```

## Impact

The trader will have motivation to do self liquidation with another wallet in control. Effectively skip some portion of fund ought to pay to the protocol.

## Recommendation

In `setPerpRiskParams()`, add checks for price offset and insurance fee, to make sure the insurance fee is larger than the offset, so that self liquidation is not profitable.
