# Unchecked external call in JOJOView.sol

## Summary

The getFundingRate function in JOJOView.sol makes an external call to another contract without proper checks, which may lead to reentrancy attacks or other unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The getFundingRate function directly calls the getFundingRate function of the IPerpetual contract without verifying if the address is a valid contract or not.

## Impact

An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious contract address to the getFundingRate function, potentially leading to reentrancy attacks or other unexpected behavior.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add proper checks to ensure that the perp address is a valid contract before making the external call. This can be done using the isContract function available in the OpenZeppelin library or by creating a custom function to validate the address.
