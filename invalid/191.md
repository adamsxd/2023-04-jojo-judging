# liquidation happens before price protection

## Summary
checks happen after liquidation takes place
## Vulnerability Detail
when calling `liquidate` by the operator, the actual liquidation takes place then the checks where the neccessary fees can be paid happens afterwards. this means that someone can pay less during liquidation, get the assets then at the end the function reverts once all the assets have been sent to the operator leading to a loss of funds
## Impact
will lead to a loss of funds if repayment amount or insuarance is not enough
