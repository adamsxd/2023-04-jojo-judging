# for exterme leverage positions can't be liquidated

## Summary
for huge token positions with an asset that supports high total supply, liquidation won't be able to be possible.
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can make a big position more than `type(int256).max` since `maintenanceMargin` is uint  we can increase with leverage to `3billion` and  then when it gets safe casted  it will revert because it  only  accepts a type of `int256` and not `uint`
## Impact
position cant get liquidated 
```solidity
        int256 netPositionValue,
            ,
            uint256 maintenanceMargin
        ) = getTotalExposure(state, trader);
```
```solidity
   netPositionValue +
                state.primaryCredit[trader] +
                SafeCast.toInt256(state.secondaryCredit[trader]) >=
            SafeCast.toInt256(maintenanceMargin);
```
