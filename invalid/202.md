# Single-step ownership transfer can be dangerous

## Summary
Single-step ownership transfer can be dangerous
## Vulnerability Detail
Inheriting from OpenZeppelin's Ownable contract means you are using a single-step ownership transfer pattern. If an admin provides an incorrect address for the new owner this will result in none of the onlyOwner marked methods being callable again. The better way to do this is to use a two-step ownership transfer approach, where the new owner should first claim its new rights before they are transferred.
## Impact
it bricks core protocol functionality
