# Owner-Deposited JUSD Risk of Being Stuck in JUSDExchange

## Summary
The JUSDExchange contract does not provide a mechanism for the contract owner to recover any JUSD tokens that have been transferred to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner is required to transfer JUSD tokens to the JUSDExchange for users to purchase JUSD with USDC. However, once the owner has transferred the tokens to the contract, there is no way to recover them unless users buy the tokens.

## Impact
If the contract owner transfers any amount of JUSD tokens to the contract, they will be locked in the contract with no direct method of recovery.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend implementing a function that allows the contract owner to withdraw JUSD tokens from the contract
