# Potential Inaccurate Liquidation Price Calculation

## Summary

In the getLiquidationPrice function, the liquidation price calculation might result in an inaccurate value due to a possible overflow when calculating the multiplier.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the getLiquidationPrice function, the multiplier is calculated based on the liquidationThreshold parameter. However, the calculation does not account for potential integer overflow. If the value of the liquidationThreshold is large enough, the calculation of multiplier can lead to an overflow, causing an incorrect liquidation price to be returned.

## Impact

An attacker might take advantage of the inaccurate liquidation price calculation to manipulate the liquidation process or exploit arbitrage opportunities. This could potentially lead to significant losses for honest traders and the platform itself.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this issue, it is recommended to implement a proper overflow check before calculating the multiplier. This can be achieved by using the SafeMath library, which provides safe arithmetic operations that include overflow checks. By doing so, the liquidation price calculation can be made more robust and secure.
