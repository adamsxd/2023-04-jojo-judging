# There is no implementation regarding a contract signer implementing `isValidPerpetualOperator`

## Summary
There is no implementation regarding a contract signer implementing `isValidPerpetualOperator`

## Vulnerability Detail
In the documentation, signer can be an EOA or a contract that implements `isValidPerpetualOperator(address) returns(bool).`

```solidity
    struct Order {
        // address of perpetual market
        address perp;
        /*
            Signer is trader, the identity of trading behavior,
            whose balance will be changed.
            Normally it should be an EOA account and the 
            order is valid only if the signer signed it.
            If the signer is a contract, it must implement
            isValidPerpetualOperator(address) returns(bool).
```

However, during the validation of the signer in `approveTrade`, there is no check regarding whether the signer is an EOA or a contract, nor checking if the contract implements isValidPerpetualOperator,  given the address is a contract.

```solidity
            address recoverSigner = ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signatureList[i]);
            // requirements
            require(
                recoverSigner == order.signer ||
                    state.operatorRegistry[order.signer][recoverSigner],
                Errors.INVALID_ORDER_SIGNATURE
```

## Impact
Contract signer that sends order is not accommodated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement the interface check for a contract address according to the specification.
