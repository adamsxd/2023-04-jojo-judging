# When the JUSDExchange is closed users can't make use of the flashloan() to repay their debts using collateral they already have deposited in the protocol, and liquidations can be executed, causing borrowers to lose funds without a chance to repay

## Summary
The JUSDExchange can be closed and opened by the admin, when the Exchange is closed, the only way for users to repay their debts is if they already have JUSD or if they have more funds to deposit as collateral to mint more JUSD, thus, causing borrowers to not be able to repay their debts and potentially their positions falling into liquidation.

As for liquidation, a malicious user who has JUSD can liquidate all of these positions falling into the liquidation state, causing borrowers to lose their funds without a chance to repay

## Vulnerability Detail
**As for the borrowers who can't repay their debts because JUSDExchange is closed**
- For those **users who don't already have JUSD and have no extra funds out of the system, they won't be able to mint more JUSD.**

The function [flashloan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L224-L245) won't work because the JUSDExchange is closed and the [buyJUSD()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDExchange.sol#L41-L46) will revert, thus, the purpose of flashloan() which looks like that allows users to use part of their extra collateral already deposited in the system to repay their debts (or a portion of it)

**As for the malicious user gaining the advantage of the JUSDExchange being closed**
- A malicious user who has JUSD can liquidate positions even though the JUSDExchange is closed.

1. The malicious user deploys a contract similar to the [FlashLoanLiquidate.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol), and it basically [removes the logic of swapping collateral and buyingJUSD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L52-L78), leaving only the [logic to liquidate the positions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L79-L96)
2. The user funds this new malicious contract with JUSD that he already had
3. The attacker calls the liquidate() and encodes the address of its malicious contract in the [afterOperationParam](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L148) parameter
4. The liquidation process starts and when it reaches the invocation to the internal function [_afterLiquidateOperations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L179-L185) it will forward the `afterOperationParam` as it was sent by the malicious user.
5. The _afterLiquidateOperations() will [decode the `afterOperationParam](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L474-L477), and it will use the encoded address to set the `flashloanAddress` of the [contract that will be called to perform the payments required by the liquidation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L486-L491)
6. Finally, the execution comes back the `liquidate()` and validates that the balances were updated correctly.

- An in this way, a malicious user has taken advantage by liquidating all the positions from users who were unable to repay their debts because the JUSD Exchange was closed

## Impact
Positions will be forced to liquidation while their owners won't be able to repay debts to avoid liquidation.
Borrowers will lose their funds and malicious users will gain the incentive of liquidate positions


## Code Snippet
- JUSDExchange can be closed: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDExchange.sol#L42
- FlashLoan contract address to liquidate positions is received as a parameter: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L148
- The repayments are made on an external contract that the address of such a contract is received as a parameter: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L486-L491
- Malicious user removes all the logic involved in buying JUSD on the FlashLoan contract that will be deployed and used to liquidate the positions: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L52-L78

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Consider disallowing liquidations when JUSDExchange is disabled
- Another remediation might be to set the address of the FlashLoan contract to a contract's variable instead of being received as a parameter when the liquidation() is called
  - In this way, the liquidation process must call the FlashLoan contract controlled by the protocol,  and when the Flashloan contract attempts to run the buyJUSD() of the JUSDExchange, if the exchange is closed, the liquidation will be reverted
