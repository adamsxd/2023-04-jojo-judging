# Bad calculation on Liquidation.sol#getLiquidationprice()

## Summary

In Liquidation.sol#getLiquidationprice() we have these long comments : 

```solidity
To avoid liquidation, we need:
netValue >= maintenanceMargin

We first calculate the maintenanceMargin for all other markets' positions.
Let's call it maintenanceMargin'

Then we have netValue of the account.
Let's call it netValue'

So we have:
    netValue' + paperAmount * price + creditAmount >= maintenanceMargin' + abs(paperAmount) * price * liquidationThreshold

if paperAmount > 0
    paperAmount * price * (1-liquidationThreshold) >= maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount 
    price >= (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1-liquidationThreshold)
    liqPrice = (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1-liquidationThreshold)

if paperAmount < 0
    paperAmount * price * (1+liquidationThreshold) >= maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount 
    price <= (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1+liquidationThreshold)
    liqPrice = (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1+liquidationThreshold)

Let's call 1Â±liquidationThreshold "multiplier"
Then:
    liqPrice = (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/multiplier

If liqPrice<0, it should be considered as the position can never be
liquidated (absolutely safe) or being liquidated at the present if return 0.
```


## Vulnerability Detail

If you follow how calcul is done you will find that 

```solidity
if paperAmount > 0
        paperAmount * price * (1-liquidationThreshold) >= maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount
				//@audit False
				price >= (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1-liquidationThreshold)
if paperAmount < 0
        paperAmount * price * (1+liquidationThreshold) >= maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount 
        //@audit False
				price <= (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1+liquidationThreshold)
```

Error is simply made because of this assumption : 

$$
A * B * (1 - C) >= D - E - F <=> A >= (D - E - F) /B /(1-C)
$$

Which is the same as

$$
A * B * (1 - C) >= D - E - F <=> A >= (D - E - F)*(1-C)/B
$$

But the good calcul is like this

$$
A * B * (1 - C) >= D - E - F <=> A >= (D - E - F) / (B * (1-C))
$$


## Impact
Instead of being divided `(1-+liquidationThreshold)`, it is multiplied by it so the liquidation price returned by this function is false.
It could result in liquidator misleading on their liquidation process, moreover it could lead owner of contracts think that positions are still well maintained but there are not as the price is multiplied instead of being divided which result in a huge error in this function

## Code Snippet
In the code it results in this : 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L196-L274

```solidity
int256 multiplier = paperAmount > 0
        ? SafeCast.toInt256(Types.ONE - state.perpRiskParams[perp].liquidationThreshold )            
        : SafeCast.toInt256(Types.ONE + state.perpRiskParams[perp].liquidationThreshold );
int256 liqPrice = (maintenanceMarginPrime -netValuePrime - creditAmount).decimalDiv(paperAmount).decimalDiv(multiplier);
// @audit-issue should be int256 liqPrice = (maintenanceMarginPrime -netValuePrime - creditAmount).decimalDiv(paperAmount.decimalMul(multiplier));
//E price <= (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1+liquidationThreshold)
//E liqPrice != (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/paperAmount/(1+liquidationThreshold)
//E     liqPrice = (maintenanceMargin' - netValue' - creditAmount)/(paperAmount*(1-+liquidationThreshold))
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Replace liqPrice by `int256 liqPrice = (maintenanceMarginPrime -netValuePrime - creditAmount).decimalDiv(paperAmount.decimalMul(multiplier));`
