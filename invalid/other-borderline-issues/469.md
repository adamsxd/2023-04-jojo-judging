# JUSDBank.sol : borrow does not ensure `isBorrowAllowed` enabled.

## Summary

Deposit and borrow is done by checking following bool flags.

        bool isDepositAllowed;
        //        if allow user borrow USDO
        bool isBorrowAllowed;

when there is check to ensure this for deposit function . Refer line of codes here for [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L255). But there is no such check for [_borrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L274-L283)

## Vulnerability Detail
 

## Impact

This would cause issue when borrow is paused.
Not sure how long the impact could be. But one possible place where this could affect is in switching to new phases where some of the functionality would be paused temporary.
