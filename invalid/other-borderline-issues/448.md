# `updateFundingRate` is not accruing previous changes

## Summary

`updateFundingRate` will be called often, but because intermediary values do not accrue, positions will end up not paying the appropriate amount of funding rates.

This means that accounts are not being paid by the other side

## Vulnerability Detail

Intuitively:
[You need a gain of 25% to recoup from a loss of 20%](https://www.financialexpress.com/money/your-portfolio-needs-to-gain-25-to-recover-a-loss-of-20-know-the-maths/2487174/) meaning that not accruing intermediary values is not making each user paying appropriate maintenance fees

If funding rate was properly applied to all positions, then each change in funding rate should alter their value

```solidity

    function balanceOf(
        address trader
    ) external view returns (int256 paper, int256 credit) {
        paper = int256(balanceMap[trader].paper);
        credit =
            paper.decimalMul(fundingRate) +
            int256(balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit);
    }

    function updateFundingRate(int256 newFundingRate) external onlyOwner {
        int256 oldFundingRate = fundingRate;
        fundingRate = newFundingRate;
        emit UpdateFundingRate(oldFundingRate, newFundingRate);
    }
```

More specifically:
- Up, down up

Can result in different behaviour, instead of the exact new value it should be

-> Accrue only when convenient via no-ops to get free money / accrue better yield
-> You'd instead need to apply a mulitplier at index (and perhaps cover the old ones) as a way to ensure accrual has happened as intend

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Store a global index multiplier, with a given timestamp, that can be used to compare the last index from each account

This will ensure that compound funding rate changes are applied as intended and don't leak value

## On High Severity
While Med may be considered, updating fundingRate is not a "optional" setting, it's a core part of the protocol, meaning the incorrect Math and the opportunity to profit from it will present itself very frequently

c.neweStep()
## We got a gain
c.neweStep()
print(c.rate())
print(c.paper())
print(c.reducedCredit())

## Simulate a loss
c.setRate(9e17, {"from": a[0]})

## Skip
c.neweStep()
print(c.rate())
print(c.paper())
print(c.reducedCredit())

## Back to a gain
c.setRate(1.1e18, {"from": a[0]})

c.neweStep()
print(c.rate())
print(c.paper())
print(c.reducedCredit())

```

As you can see changes are not compounded which means that fees are not being paid to the account
