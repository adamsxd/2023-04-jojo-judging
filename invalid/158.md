# The function `liquidate` from the `JUSDBank.sol` will revert almost every time making liquidations impossible

## Summary
The function `liquidate` calls the function `_calculateLiquidateAmount` which will revert almost all the time because of overflowing.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `liquidate` calls `_calculateLiquidateAmount` to get the `LiquidateData`. After few require statements and verifications the function gets the `price` from the `IPriceChainLink` and then calculates the `priceOff`. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L396-L399 The problem relies in the face that `priceOff` is calculated by multiplying the `price` with the result of the subtraction of `DecimalMath.ONE` with `reserve.liquidationPriceOff`.
 `DecimalMath.ONE` is 1e18 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/lib/DecimalMath.sol#L8 and `reserve.liquidationPriceOff` is an 1e18 based decimal number https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/lib/DataTypes.sol#L23-L28 which means that the subtraction will always revert, beside when `reserve.liquidationPriceOff` is 1e18 which makes the `priceOff` being 0. In this only case where the function will not revert `liquidateAmount`, will also be 0 and only the first if statement will ever pass https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L410-L434 making `liquidateData.insuranceFee`, `liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0`, `liquidateData.actualLiquidated` be also 0.
## Impact
The impact is a high one since liquidation process will be impossible almost every time because of the overflow.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the way the `priceOff` gets calculated since the subtraction will revert every time if `reserve.liquidationPriceOff` will be greater than 1e18
