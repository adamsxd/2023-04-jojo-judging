# Unchecked Collateral Leftovers in Flashloan Implementations


## Summary

The three contracts implementing `JOJOFlashLoan` callbacks do not check for leftover collateral after swap operations. This oversight could lead to stuck collateral in the contract due to bad calldata sent to third-party swap traders.

## Vulnerability Details

All three Flashloan implementations only check the [USDC balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L72) after a trade/swap but do not verify if there was any leftover collateral after the swap. Since swap data is prepared by the user (in this case, JOJO frontend code), it is possible that not all collateral is swapped entirely after an external call. This lack of verification might result in stuck leftover collateral not being returned to the liquidator.

## Impact

Failing to check for leftover trade assets after a swap might cause collateral to get "stuck" in the contract due to bad calldata sent to third-party swap traders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Considering the low cost of L2 Arbitrum prices, it is recommended to send all `asset` token balances to the liquidator.
