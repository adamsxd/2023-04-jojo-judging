# DIVISION BEFORE MULTIPLICATION COULD INCUR UNNECESSARY PRECISION LOSS

## Summary
The last 2 lines of the `getMarkPrice` calculated the `tokenPrice` by first dividing `USDCPrice` and immediately in the line that follow, the `tokenPrice` is further Multiplied by 1e18. When it involves multiplication and division, division should always be done last.

## Vulnerability Detail
Division was done by `SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice)` before multiplication by 1e18 on the last line of the `getMarkPrice` function below.
```solidity
function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        //@audit No sequencer check for arbitrum.
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice,, updatedAt,) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
       //@audit first division by USDCPrice on the next line.
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        //@audit and further a multiplication was done here.
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection; //@audit div before mul
    }
```
## Impact
Division before multiplication could incur unnecessary precision loss which can return non precise prices and cause fund loss to users.

## Recommendation
When it involves Multiplication and division, all division should be implemented last in order not incur unnecessary precision loss.
