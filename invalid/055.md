# JOJOExternal's requestWithdraw should validate for non zero on primary or secondary

## Summary
JOJOExternal contract's requestWithdraw does not check for primaryAmount or secondaryAmount to be non zero. Atleast one of them should be non zero before the call is delegated to funding library's requestWithdraw function.

When the execution of withdrawl is called, the notifications will be fired to offchain with out any effective transfer of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Zero movement of funds or value in state.
Wastage of processing interms of gas
Unnessary Events are fired to off chain when the execution of the withdrawl is completed.

## Impact
wastage of gas and unnessary events being fired. Other wise, there is no negative impact or state of balances.
