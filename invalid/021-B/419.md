# A an attacker  stop the protocol from removing bad debt

## Summary
 an attacker can deposit to `JUSD` and there is no check if their address is safe, so they can add their collateral to the  array and stop the protocol from removing their bad debt 
## Vulnerability Detail
an attacker can deposit funds even though they have bad debt and add collateral tokens to their array before the protocol removes their bad debt and it will cause the `owner` tx to revert.
ex:
 at t0 .J(attacker) has a bad debt of 5 JUSD
at t1 the protocol trying removing their bad debt 
alice front runs that tx and adds  1 JUSD to their account and adds a collateral to their array 
now when `handleBadDebt` is called  it will revert.

## Impact
bad debt that is  not getting erased and dos for protocol
## Code Snippet
This require will revert 
```solidity
  liquidatedTraderInfo.collateralList.length == 0 &&
```
when the attacker deposits there is no check if they are safe like `withdraw` has 
```solidity
require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);
        user.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
        reserve.totalDepositAmount += amount;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add  `account safe` function to deposit like withdraw
```solidity
        require(
            _isAccountSafe(user, tRate),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
```
