# Delisting collateral prevents user from withdrawing, even though this collateral is no longer used to back up a loan

## Summary
Delisting collateral effectively sets the value of user's this collateral to 0. Even if the protocol chooses not to support any particular collateral, users should still be able to withdraw them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The maximum amount that a user can mint is based on `_maxMintAmount`. This value needs to be sufficient to ensure that an account is safe, i.e. `_isAccountSafe()`. 

When a collateral is delisted, `reserve.isBorrowAllowed = false`, and hence calculation for `maxMintAmount` for this delisted collateral is skipped. 

A user who has previously used this collateral for a loan will no longer be able to use it for borrowing, and at the same time will be unable to withdraw this collateral as the account is not safe.

The user can only withdraw the delisted collateral if they remain safe regardless of the value of this, now 0 value collateral. 

## Impact
When a collateral is delisted, users can be caught off guard. Value of the collateral is deemed to be 0 by the protocol, and users will be unable to withdraw them in some circumstances.
