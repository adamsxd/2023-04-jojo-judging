# the Funding.sol contract:executeWithdraw function has some problems in logic

## Summary
the Funding.sol contract:executeWithdraw function has some problems in logic in primaryAmount and pendingPrimaryWithdraw same in  secondaryAmount and secondaryPrimaryWithdraw
## Vulnerability Detail
in line 111 we can see the `uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
`
then it makes  `state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;` 



## Impact
 basically, if user wants to Withdraw primary again for a second time they will face error in withdrawing because logic cannot transfer 0 amount because primaryAmount set to 0 second time 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
   function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
        uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
        // withdraw amount to 0.
        _withdraw(
            state,
            msg.sender,
            to,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            isInternal
        );
    }
