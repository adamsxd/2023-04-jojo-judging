# [H-01] Due to gas griefing attack offchain engine account could loses significant amount.

## Summary

Due to gas griefing attack offchain engine account could lose significant amount.
Such attack vector could significantly harm offchain engine, because order sender (makers/takers) are sending their order via offchain mechanism. Than engine handles them and send matched orders to smart contract `Perpetual.sol` to `trade()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Attack vector:
1) Attacker makes `11` different offchain accounts at trader desk.`1` for taker order, `10 `for maker orders;
2) Attacker chooses perp with low nominal price asset, like ARB (currently `1.5 USD `cost);
3) Attacker sends `10` same taker orders with `paper: 1`,  `creditAmount:` like `1.5242` (closed to current perp price, to avoid hit at another orders)
4) Attacker send `1` maker order with `paper:10` `creditAmount: 1.542` ti take especially his orders with this amount.
5) As a result engine will handle this in 1 pack/transaction and send to smart contract (11 orders);
6) Cost of this tx at arbitrum currently will be: `1339392 gas`, what currently costs `0.2544 USD`;

7) Attacker repeats it let's say `100k` times, total gas paid by engine will be:

##Cost of attack:

There are maker fee and taker fee in protocol.
Average maker fee at dydx:

Let's take `maker fee: 0.02%` and `taker fee: 0.05%` .

-For 1 taker order, fee will be: `1 paper_quantity` * `1 ARB_quantity`  * `0.05%_fee`. Total in USD : `1 * 1.5$ * 0.05% =  0.00075$`;

-For 10 maker orders, fee will be: `1 paper_quantity` * `1 ARB_quantity`  * `0.02%_fee * 10 orders_quantity`. Total in USD : `1 * 1.5$ * 0.02% * 10 = 0.003$`;

This mean per 1 pack (`1+10` orders) attacker will be charged by SC: `0.00075$+0.003$ = 0.00375$`.
Let's compare again. 
Fees paid by attacker: `0.00375$`. Gas paid by engine: `0.2527 USD`.
There are no other loses by attacker, because he takes own orders. Such iteration due to the HFT-nature of engine could be replayed many times, let's say 100k.
Fees paid by attacker: `0.00375$*100_000 = 375$`. Gas paid by engine: `0.2527 USD * 100_000=25270$`.

Let's look at gas consumption:

gas left pre:    9079256848772301364 (so huge by foundry default)
gas left after: 9079256848770967734 (so huge by foundry default)
Gas difference/quantity: 1339392

## Impact
Offchain engine account could be totally griefed by attacker.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add additional check while parsing orders to avoid similar orders from one signer to particular limit or add higher fees for such cases.
