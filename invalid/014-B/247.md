# Withdraw timelock can be bypassed easily in JOJODealer.sol

## Summary

Withdraw timelock can be bypassed 

## Vulnerability Detail

We have JOJODealer.sol contract

```solidity
contract JOJODealer is JOJOExternal, JOJOOperation, JOJOView {
    constructor(address _primaryAsset) JOJOStorage() {
        state.primaryAsset = _primaryAsset;
    }

    function version() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "JOJODealer V1.0";
    }
}
```

all external call is handled by JOJOExternal

when user deposit, the user credit is implemented

```solidity
function deposit(
	uint256 primaryAmount,
	uint256 secondaryAmount,
	address to
) external nonReentrant {
	Funding.deposit(state, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, to);
}
```

calling

```solidity
  function deposit(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount,
        address to
    ) external {
        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                primaryAmount
            );
            state.primaryCredit[to] += SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
        }
        if (secondaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                secondaryAmount
            );
            state.secondaryCredit[to] += secondaryAmount;
        }
        emit Deposit(to, msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
    }
```

when user withdraw, first user needs to call requestWithdraw

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(uint256 primaryAmount, uint256 secondaryAmount)
	external
	nonReentrant
{
	Funding.requestWithdraw(state, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
}
```

calling

```solidity
  function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }
```

then when withdraw is executed, 

```solidity

    function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
        uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
        // withdraw amount to 0.
        _withdraw(
            state,
            msg.sender,
            to,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            isInternal
        );
    }
```

we notice the issue, the request withdraw uses

```solidity
state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender]
```

and

```solidity
state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender]
```

to track the pending withdraw and it is different from credit tracking 

```solidity
 state.primaryCredit[msg.sender]
```

and the request withdraw never validate the amount of requested fund and make sure the withdraw amount is less than the available user balance

for example,

user only use 100 USDC credit

user request withdraw for 1000 USDC credit,

then after the timelock, combing with the fact that the withdrawal request never expires and user can withdraw any time

let us say he make a trade and make 1000 USDC, or someone deposit for him another 900 USDC

the user can executeWithdraw immediately and withdraw 1000 USDC

instead of withdraw 100 USDC first and create another withdrawal request and wait for the timelock

## Impact

Withdraw timelock can be bypassed easily, allow user to game the withdraw mechanism

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol validate the requested withdrawal amount
