# Unbounded loops can lead to denial of service

## Summary

Unbounded loops can lead to denial of service. This affects loops in [`JUSDBank` collaterals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L457), [`JOJODealer`'s traders' open positions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L63), and [`JOJODealer`'s registered perpetuals](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L52).

## Vulnerability Detail

Many parts of the system contain unbounded loops on state variable arrays. Some of those may grow as the protocol changes the supported collaterals or perpetuals markets on the system. Depending on these values, calls to functions such as `JUSDBank._removeEmptyCollateral`, `Liquidation.getTotalExposure` and `Operation.setPerpRiskParams` may revert due to exceed gas limit. 

Depending on the number of perpetual markets, for example, calls to `Liquidation._isSafe` or `Liquidation._isSolidSafe` may revert, making it impossible to liquidate traders under water.

## Impact

Denial of Service dependent on the number of collaterals or perpetuals in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a hard cap limit on the number of collaterals and perpetual markets so that looping over these lists do not revert.
