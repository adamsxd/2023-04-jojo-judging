# Potential Front-Running Attack

## Summary

A potential front-running attack may be exploited by malicious miners or bots monitoring pending transactions. Since the `_matchOrders` function lacks any protection against front-running, attackers can observe pending trades and submit their own orders with better prices, causing the original orders to be executed at less favorable terms.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_matchOrders` function in Trading.sol handles the matching of taker and maker orders. However, there is no mechanism in place to prevent front-running attacks. Since transactions are processed in the order they are included in the block, attackers can submit their own transactions with higher gas fees to have them executed before the original transactions.

## Impact

Front-running attacks can cause significant financial losses for traders, as their orders may be executed at unfavorable prices. This can result in a loss of trust in the platform and lead to decreased usage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate front-running attacks, consider implementing a commit-reveal scheme or using a decentralized order book with a decentralized matching engine. Additionally, introducing a randomized delay in the order processing or a gas price cap can help minimize the attack surface.
