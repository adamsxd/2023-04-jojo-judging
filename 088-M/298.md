# Update new `borrowFeeRate` cause inverse debt calculation

## Summary

When updating the `borrowFeeRate` in the JOJO protocol, it also resets the timestamp and leads to an inverse debt calculation for all users. This results in users repaying less JUSD than they initially borrowed.

## Vulnerability Details

JOJO uses the following interest rate formula: `borrow + interest = borrow USD / previousInterestRate * currentInterestRate`. 
Updating the new `borrowFeeRate` resets the timestamp, making the `currentInterestRate` equal to `t0Rate` or the interest rate at the starting time. 
Since `t0Rate` is 1e18 and the `previousInterestRate` is slightly larger than 1e18 (~1.0002e18), resetting the interest rate results in the `currentInterestRate` being smaller than the `previousInterestRate` for some time.

JOJO stores `t0BorrowAmount`, which is the borrow amount if the interest rate was at t0 (time with zero interest) [source](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L283-L287).
The [calculation for the current debt or repay amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L315) can be simplified as `currentDebt = t0BorrowAmount * currentInterestRate / previousInterestRate`.
Since `currentInterestRate / previousInterestRate < 1.0`, the debt users have to repay will always be smaller than the original borrow amount.

## Impact

User repay JUSD less than borrow JUSD amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Split the `updateBorrowFeeRate()` function into two separate functions: one for changing the `borrowFeeRate` and another for resetting the timestamp. 
This ensures that the timestamp is only reset when all collateral borrow is disabled and after the owner has liquidated all ongoing debts.
