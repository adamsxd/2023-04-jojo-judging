# Insufficient JUSD balance in JUSDExchange contract will prevent users to buy JUSD.

## Summary
In the JUSDExchange contract, users may be unable to exchange USDC for JUSD via the `buyJUSD` function, should the contract not hold sufficient JUSD.

## Vulnerability Detail
The JUSDExchange contract includes a `buyJUSD` function that transfers JUSD tokens from the contract to a user's address. If the contract does not hold enough JUSD tokens to facilitate the exchange, the transaction will fail and revert, thereby preventing the user from completing the exchange.

## Impact
This issue could lead to user dissatisfaction and mistrust in the platform, as users may not be able to convert their USDC into JUSD when desired.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is to either implement a check for sufficient JUSD balance in the contract before initiating transfers, or to establish a "mint-on-demand" functionality that comes into effect once the user has transferred the USDC.
