# Front-running vulnerability in executeWithdraw function

## Summary

The executeWithdraw function in Funding.sol may be vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the lack of any access control mechanisms.

## Vulnerability Detail

The executeWithdraw function is responsible for processing the user's withdrawal after the time lock expires. However, it is accessible to anyone, potentially allowing a malicious actor to front-run the transaction and withdraw the funds to their address.

## Impact

A malicious actor can potentially intercept and redirect a user's withdrawal to their address, resulting in loss of funds for the user.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access control to ensure that only the user who requested the withdrawal can execute it. One possible solution is to add a require statement checking that msg.sender is the user who initially requested the withdrawal:

```solidity
require(msg.sender == user, "Not authorized");
```
