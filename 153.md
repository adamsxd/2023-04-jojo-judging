# User is not allowed to increase collateral freely

## Summary
a user is allowed to increase collateral only if :

```solidity
user.depositBalance[collateral] <= reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount
reserve.totalDepositAmount <= reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount
```

## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see, in the JUSDBank.sol#L247._deposit() function, a user is allowed to increase collateral only if :

```solidity
        require(
            user.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
        );
        require(
            reserve.totalDepositAmount <= reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_TOTAL
        );

```

total Deposit Amount is related to all user's deposits. So one user can add more collateral than another user, making the other users unable to add more collateral.

Let's assume that the user deposit is not reached maxDepositAmountPerAccount, but the problem is, if the user has a loan and there is a risk of liquidation for the user position, the user is not allowed to increase collateral freely if maxTotalDepositAmount is reached for reserve.totalDepositAmount. 

## Impact
The user is not allowed to increase collateral freely and will get liquidated.

`user.depositBalance[collateral] <= reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,`
