# Bypass withdrawal timelock

## Summary

It is possible to avoid the withdrawal timelock by initiating the request upfront.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawal is implemented as a 2-step process. First, users have to `requestWithdraw`, and then after the specific period has passed, `executeWithdraw`:
```solidity
    function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }

    function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
        uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
        // withdraw amount to 0.
        _withdraw(
            state,
            msg.sender,
            to,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            isInternal
        );
    }
```

However, the `requestWithdraw` does not check if the user has already deposited, thus making it possible to request a withdrawal of funds you have not yet deposited. Then, after the `withdrawTimeLock` passes, the user can deposit these assets, and instantly withdraw if necessary.

## Impact

The 2-step withdrawal process does not work as intended and can be bypassed if first requesting a withdrawal, then waiting for the unlock and depositing. Users who take advantage of this issue can instantly withdraw their funds with no delay.

## Recommendation

When requesting the withdrawal, check if the user's balance is sufficient. Also, consider implementing a withdraw window, e.g. users must execute withdrawals in < 3 days after the request becomes active, otherwise should start the request again.
