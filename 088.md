# Lack of transaction expiration timestamp in `repay()` in JUSDV1

## Summary
The idea of repay is to unlock collateral to withdraw. But for user there is no value to repay when debt is higher than collateral market value - and it can happen in case when transaction was pending in mempool for so long, such that collateral price went down.
There is no mechanism to prevent this.

DEXes use transaction deadline checking to prevent users from disadvantageous swaps

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no checking deadline functionality
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L119-L126
```solidity
    function repay(
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        return _repay(user, msg.sender, to, amount, tRate);
    }
```

## Impact
User repays debt and looses money, because collateral price went down by the time the transaction is included in the block

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add deadline argument and check it
```solidity
modifier ensure(uint deadline) {
	require(deadline >= block.timestamp, 'EXPIRED');
	_;
}
    function repay(
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external override nonReentrant ensure(deadline) returns (uint256) {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        return _repay(user, msg.sender, to, amount, tRate);
    }
```
