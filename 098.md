# signer not checked to be zero, allowing griefing attack

## Summary
In JOJOExternal, ECDSA recover returned address is not checked for zero address. According to OpenZepellin's docs, recover does not revert and instead return 0 address on error. This opens up an attack vector for griefing by allowing order.signer to be zero address.

## Vulnerability Detail

Notice that in `recoverSigner`, ECDSA.recover by OpenZepellin is used to recover address from signature and hash. However, no zero check is performed. Hence, order.signer can be zero which opens up attack vector for griefing.
```solidity
            address recoverSigner = ECDSA.recover(orderHash, signatureList[i]);
            // requirements
            require(
                recoverSigner == order.signer ||
                    state.operatorRegistry[order.signer][recoverSigner],
                Errors.INVALID_ORDER_SIGNATURE
            );

```


## Impact
order.signer can be zero address.
