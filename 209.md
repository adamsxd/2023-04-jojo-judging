# Slippage at withdraw functions

## Summary
The code consists of two functions, requestWithdraw and executeWithdraw, which allow users to withdraw tokens from the contract. However, the vulnerability in these functions is that they do not take any slippage parameter, which can expose users to slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the fact that the functions do not consider the possibility of price fluctuations while executing the trade. In other words, if the price of the token changes between the time a user requests a withdrawal and the time the withdrawal is executed, the user may end up receiving fewer tokens than expected. This can happen due to the slippage incurred during the trade. Moreover, without a slippage parameter, the functions do not prevent an attacker from front-running the trade and exploiting the user by manipulating the price of the token during the execution of the trade

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability can be significant, as users may end up losing tokens due to slippage or front-running attacks.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to include a slippage parameter in the functions, which will allow users to set a maximum slippage tolerance for their trades.
