# Anyone can create new instances of the EmergencyOracle contract through `newEmergencyOracle()`

## Summary
`newEmergencyOracle()` is set to public that can executed by everyone. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `newEmergencyOracle()` function in the `EmergencyOracleFactory` contract is marked as external, which means anyone can call this function. When a user executes the `newEmergencyOracle()` function, a new `EmergencyOracle` contract is created, and the caller of the function (i.e., the msg.sender) becomes the owner of the newly created EmergencyOracle instance.

Let's say Alice and Bob execute the `newEmergencyOracle()` function at the same time. 
The two instances will be independent of each other, and each instance will have its own owner.
Based on blockchain, transactions are processed in a sequential manner within a single block. 
Even if Alice and Bob submit their transactions at the same time, one of them will be included in the block before the other. 
The exact order depends on factors such as gas price and miner selection. 
As a result, one EmergencyOracle instance will be created before the other, but both instances will be created successfully.

However, since Alice and Bob create separate instances of EmergencyOracle, it might be challenging to keep track of all the created instances. This could make it more difficult for users to identify trustworthy oracles and may introduce potential security risks.

## Impact
A malicious actor could create a false oracle with manipulated data to exploit the system or profit from unsuspecting users.
