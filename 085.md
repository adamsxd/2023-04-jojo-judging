# Wrong t0Amount calculation can result in a loss of funds

## Summary
Wrong `t0Amount` calculation can lead to loss of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
In `JUSDBank.sol` in `_borrow()` method `t0Amount` is calculated as follows
```solidity
uint256 t0Amount = tAmount.decimalRemainder(tRate)
            ? tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate)
            : tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate) + 1;
```
then in `_repay()` when calculating the same amount the `tRate` is not taken into account.
```solidity
t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate);
```

## Impact
This miscalculation can lead to loss of funds for users, although it is not a big loss, it should be considered.

## Recommendation
Calculate `t0Amount` in `_repay()` the same way it is calculated in `_borrow()`
