# [M-03] FlashLoanRepay.sol has no access control. Attacker can steal assets from contract if they are there.

## Summary
SC: `FlashLoanRepay.sol`
Main feature of this contract to swap user's collateral (ARB/wETH etc.) to USDC, than to JUSD and make repayment to `jusdBank`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function  `JOJOFlashLoan()` does not have access modifier `onlyJUSDBank()`.
This mean everyone could call this function with custom params  ti trigger `swapTarget.call(data)` to send contract's assets to attacker.
Due to the fact that this contract not implemented to store assets, this does not negate the fact that the assets could be stored be here(airdrop/any surplus due to flashloan etc).
