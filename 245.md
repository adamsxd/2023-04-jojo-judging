# Borrowers might be instantly liquidated when a collateral token delisted with no chance of withdraw

## Summary
In the JUSD protocol, when a reserve is delisted, it's not allowed to be deposited or borrowed against and the value is considered zero in the system by design. But there is no on-chain implementation of delay or protection in place to allow users with the delisted collateral token to withdraw or deposit before being instantly considered liquidatable.  
## Vulnerability Detail
In JUSD, a reserve can be listed and delisted according to the business needs/scenarios. When a reserve is delisted, by design a user cannot deposit or borrow against the delisted reserve and the value of a delisted collateral is considered zero. A user can still withdraw a delisted asset. 

In such situation, in order to be considered sufficiently collateralized, a user might need to either deposit extra listed reserves, or repay some portion of debts before withdrawing delisted collaterals. However, in JUSDView.sol `_isStartLiquidation`, there is no delay factor in place for a delisted collateral to be counted as zero to allow user to repay their debt or deposit more collaterals. Instead, the accounting for the delisted collateral is directly bypassed resulting any users holding a delisted collateral to be instantly liquidatable. 

```solidity
            if (reserve.isFinalLiquidation) {
                continue;
            }
```

Such liquidation would be quite profitable for liquidators since liquidated account could be considered good standing previously with low debt ratio to repay, and also selling the delisted collaterals would generate great profit margins. And the liquidated account would lose all collaterals without having a chance to withdraw the delisted assets.

Even though reserve delisting is the designed behavior, there should be proper protection/delay in place to avoid extensive liquidations at the expense of users in good standing.

## Impact
Users holding a delisted collateral asset may not have a chance to repay or deposit to withdraw the delisted collaterals before losing all collaterals. A malicious liquidator could make significant profit by mass liquidation when there is wide collateral value drop.

## Recommendation
Delisting a reserve is a drastic change of context for exiting borrowers,  proper on-chain protection is needed to protect borrowers in good standing experiencing extensive financial loss in the process. Consider adding a delay parameter to avoid instant liquidation, or for users who couldn't make the deposit or withdraw in time to allow a discounted conversion to other listed reserve within a grace period.
