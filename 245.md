# A malicious actor could make JUSDBank.deposit() run into DoS to other depositors when reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount is nearing to its cap

## Summary
In [JUSDV1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-raymondfam/tree/main/JUSDV1), `JUSDBank.deposit()` could be denied if a malicious actor is always there to front run the transaction with minute amount of collateral  just enough to make `reserve.totalDepositAmount > reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount` when `reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount` is `reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount` away from its capped limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_deposit()`, the conditions for `reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount` and `reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount` are checked after the deposit has been made. If Bob, a malicious actor, can successfully front-run Alice's transaction that is intended to use up the last available quota, he can deposit 1 wei before her transaction is processed, causing her transaction to fail due to exceeding the maximum allowed deposit amounts.

## Impact
If Bob continues to do this every time Alice tries to deposit with a 1 wei reduced amount, Alice's deposits will repeatedly fail. This is a form of a front-running attack, which can be a potential vulnerability in the code.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider having `_deposit()` refactored as follows:

```diff
    function _deposit(
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve,
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from
    ) internal {
        require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);

+        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);

+        uint256 availablePerAccount = reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount - user.depositBalance[collateral];
+        uint256 availableTotal = reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount - reserve.totalDepositAmount;

+        uint256 availableAmount = availablePerAccount < availableTotal ? availablePerAccount : availableTotal;
+        amount = amount > availableAmount ? availableAmount : amount;

        IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
-        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);
        user.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
        reserve.totalDepositAmount += amount;
        require(
            user.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
        );
        require(
            reserve.totalDepositAmount <= reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_TOTAL
        );
        emit Deposit(collateral, from, to, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
In this version, I calculate the available amounts for both per account and total deposit, and pick the lower of the two amounts as the `availableAmount`. Then, the function adjusts the `amount` to be the minimum of the original amount and the `availableAmount`. This way, the function will pick the lower of the two amounts, ensuring that neither of the caps is exceeded. The last two require checks may be removed where deemed fit.
