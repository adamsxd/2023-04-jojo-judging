# M-4: withdrawTimeLock can be avoided

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

To avoid the withdrawTimeLock, a user can request a withdrawal with a large amount before they actually need the withdrawal. There's no limitation on the amount requested for withdrawal, and the contract does not check the user's balances. It is important to notice that withdrawal requests don't have an expiration date.

This way, the user can always have an available amount to withdraw, ensuring that they can cover at least their position. It doesn't matter if the amount is greater than their balance to withdraw, since in the same transaction where they withdraw their funds, they can deposit the shortfall to comply with the _isSolidSafe or _isSafe guards and prevent the transaction from being reverted.

According to the documentation, "the matching engine will reduce the user's available balance immediately after receiving the withdrawal request to avoid invalid matching.", but updating balances can be avoided by calling the contracts directly. 



## Impact

Users can avoid the timelock and execute their withdrawals instantly. Oracles can have a discrepancy with the actual price of the asset. Therefore, a user can advantageously use this discrepancy by frontrunning the oracle and withdrawing assets at a market price higher than the real one, this is going to be really advantageous in volatile markets. This is normally avoided in protocols with a two-step withdrawal with a timelock, as attempted here, but as we can see, it can be circumvented.

```solidity 

    function requestWithdraw( 
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }
  function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );

       //
}


  function _withdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address payer,
        address to,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount,
        bool isInternal
    ) private {

        //
       //

        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            // if trader withdraw primary asset, we should check if solid safe
            require(
                Liquidation._isSolidSafe(state, payer),
                Errors.ACCOUNT_NOT_SAFE
            );
        } else {
            // if trader didn't withdraw primary asset, normal safe check is enough
            require(Liquidation._isSafe(state, payer), Errors.ACCOUNT_NOT_SAFE);
        }
       // 
}
```

Both _isSolidSafe or _isSafe  use getTotalExposure() to verify the value of the position:

```solidity
   function getTotalExposure(Types.State storage state, address trader)
        public                                                        
        view
        returns (
            int256 netPositionValue,
            uint256 exposure,
            uint256 maintenanceMargin
        )
    {
        // sum net value and exposure among all markets
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < state.openPositions[trader].length; ) {
            (int256 paperAmount, int256 creditAmount) = IPerpetual(
                state.openPositions[trader][i]
            ).balanceOf(trader);
            Types.RiskParams storage params = state.perpRiskParams[
                state.openPositions[trader][i]
            ];
            int256 price = SafeCast.toInt256(
                IMarkPriceSource(params.markPriceSource).getMarkPrice()
            );

            netPositionValue += paperAmount.decimalMul(price) + creditAmount; 
            uint256 exposureIncrement = paperAmount.decimalMul(price).abs();
            exposure += exposureIncrement;
            maintenanceMargin +=
                (exposureIncrement * params.liquidationThreshold) / 
                Types.ONE;

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }



```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This problem can be solved by adding an expiration time to the withdrawal request.
