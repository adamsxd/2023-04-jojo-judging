# user can re-send requestWithdraw, wiping the previous pending withdrawal

## Summary
user can re-send requestWithdraw, wiping the previous pending withdrawal

## Vulnerability Detail
`updatePrimaryAsset` does not checks whether the new PrimaryAsset has the same decimal as the secondaryAsset.

```solidity
    function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
```
## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation

check the pendingPrimaryWithdraw to either:

1.) add the amount to the existing pending amount, and update the withdrawExecutionTimestamp
2.) revert if there is already a non-zero pending withdrawal.
