# Oracle is not checking for sequencer uptime

## Summary
The Arbitrum Sequencer can allow tx to be queued while the L2 is offline, these will pass the freshness check but use outdated prices.

**Although the project team stated in the documentation that Chainlink's failure is acceptable, I believe this situation is different because it makes the system unfair. Attackers can use non-real-time prices for trading while most normal users cannot trade properly.**
## Vulnerability Detail
Because of how Arbitrum works, if the L2 goes offline, tx can still be sent via the [Delayed inbox](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4dbd4fc535ac27206064b68ffcf827b0a60bab3f) on L1.

This could allow the creation of orders which use prices from when the Sequencer was down, which would still pass the freshness check, but may be incorrect or outdated.

If Chainlink failure results in the same impact on all users, then I think it is acceptable. However, the project team needs to avoid situations that create unfairness.
## Impact
Attackers can use non-real-time prices for trading while most normal users cannot trade properly.
