# Users can incidentally DOSed themselves if too many positions are opened

## Summary
A user that has opened too many position will no longer be able to `_realizePnL`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Each new position opened adds to the size of the array `openPositions[]`.

```solidity
function _openPosition(Types.State storage state, address trader) internal {
    state.openPositions[trader].push(msg.sender);
}
```

This array is looped through in `_realizePnL`. Due to the maximum block gas limit of the evm, if the size of the array is too large, user will not be able to `_realizePnL`, and hence not able to settle any of their positions. 

```solidity
function _realizePnl(
	Types.State storage state,
	address trader,
	int256 pnl
) internal {
	state.primaryCredit[trader] += pnl;
	state.positionSerialNum[trader][msg.sender] += 1;

	address[] storage positionList = state.openPositions[trader];
	for (uint256 i = 0; i < positionList.length;) {
		if (positionList[i] == msg.sender) {
			positionList[i] = positionList[positionList.length - 1];
			positionList.pop();
			break;
		}
		unchecked {
			++i;
		}
	}
}
```

Furthermore, the only way in which positions can be trimmed is that their profits have been realized. There is no other way to remove a position. Hence, when a user reaches this state, their positions will be stucked.

## Impact
Assets cannot be settled, causing funds to be lost

## Recommendation
Consider adding a maximum number of positions that user can open, to prevent this state from happening.
