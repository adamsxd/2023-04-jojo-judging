# Unbounded loop iterating through open positions

## Summary

The function getTotalExposure() and _isAllSafe() have an unbounded loop iterating through all open positions, which may result in high gas consumption and out-of-gas issues if the number of open positions is large.

## Vulnerability Detail

The functions getTotalExposure() and _isAllSafe() contain loops that iterate through all open positions for a given trader or an array of traders. As the number of open positions grows, the gas consumption for these functions will increase, potentially leading to out-of-gas issues.

For `getTotalExposure()`:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < state.openPositions[trader].length; ) {
    ...
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

For `_isAllSafe()`:

```solidity
for (uint256 j = 0; j < state.openPositions[trader].length; ) {
    ...
    unchecked {
        ++j;
    }
}
```

## Impact

A trader with a large number of open positions may be unable to call functions that rely on `getTotalExposure()` and `_isAllSafe()` due to the high gas consumption, making it difficult for them to manage their positions or assess their account's safety.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a mechanism to limit the number of open positions per trader or introduce pagination in the functions to reduce gas consumption when iterating through open positions. Alternatively, consider storing aggregated values for each trader, such as total exposure, and update these values upon position changes. This would allow for constant-time access to these values without the need for iteration.
