# Operator can liquidate the accounts

## Summary
Although the documentation explicitly states that the operator cannot withdraw or liquidate for the client  ([link](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/operator#what-is-the-operator)), the `liquidate()` function includes a `isValidOperator` modifier that allows the operator of a liquidator to liquidate accounts. This contradicts the documentation and can result in confusion or misunderstandings regarding the operator's role and responsibilities.

It is important to ensure that the documentation accurately reflects the agreed-upon terms and that any discrepancies or contradictions are addressed and resolved promptly. This can help to avoid potential conflicts or legal issues in the future and promote a transparent and trustworthy relationship between the parties involved.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function liquidate(
        address liquidated,
        address collateral,
        address liquidator,
        uint256 amount,
        bytes memory afterOperationParam,
        uint256 expectPrice
    )
        external
        override
        isValidOperator(msg.sender, liquidator) //@audit https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/operator
        nonFlashLoanReentrant
        returns (DataTypes.LiquidateData memory liquidateData)
```

## Impact
According to the documentation, the operator is not authorized to liquidate accounts for the liquidator, but they may do so, which would be in violation of the agreed-upon terms.

## Recommendation
remove the isValidOperator modifier and liquidator = msg.sender
