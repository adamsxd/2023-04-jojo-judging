# `maxReserveNum` is not correctly checked in JUSDOperation

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDOperation.sol#L94-L101

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the JUSDOperation contract, there is a `maxReservesNum` that limits the number of reserves that can be added. This constraint is checked in the internal function `_addReserve()`. However, it is checked before updating the `reservesNum`. This means that in cases where `reservesNum` is already equal to `maxReservesNum`, it is still possible to add one more reserve.

## Impact
The maximum number of reserves constraint is not being checked correctly.

For example, when `maxReservesNum = 5` and currently `reservesNum = 5`, it is still allow to add one more reserve and makes `reservesNum = 6`.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _addReserve(address collateral) private {
    require(
        reservesNum <= maxReservesNum, // @audit maxReservesNum is not correctly checked
        JUSDErrors.NO_MORE_RESERVE_ALLOWED
    );
    reservesList.push(collateral);
    reservesNum += 1;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider fixing the check to ensure `reservesNum` cannot be larger than the `maxReservesNum`.
