# `JUSDBank::handleBadDept` can be dangerous

## Summary
Handling bad debt can be done in such a way that it leaves un-backed JUSD out in the market.

## Vulnerability Detail
In some cases a liquidation can leave a user with bad debt. I.e. a debt not covered by any collateral. In these cases, the protocol can move that debt over to the `insurance`:

```solidity
File: JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol

506:            uint256 borrowJUSDT0 = liquidatedTraderInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
507:            insuranceInfo.t0BorrowBalance += borrowJUSDT0;
508:            liquidatedTraderInfo.t0BorrowBalance = 0;
```

There is no guarantee that the `insurance` account has collateral backing its debt. Hence there might be non collateral backed JUSD out there. This could effect trust and in turn the price of JUSD.

## Impact
Non collateral backed JUSD is very dangerous since stable coins rely on trust. If the debt builds up on `insurance` that's coins that are out in the world which have no backing hence pushes the price down and reduces trust in the coin.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in `handleBadDept` that `insurance` is safe. Making sure there is collateral to cover the bad debt.
