# [H-03] GeneralRepay.sol has no access control. Attacker can steal user's approved funds.

## Summary
SC: `GeneralRepay.sol`
Main feature of this contract to swap user's assets(USDT or any other) to USDC and make repayment to `jusdBank`.
Due to presence `safeTransferFrom()` in `repayJUSD()` user must approves assets(e.g. USDT) to this contract before call `repayJUSD()`;

## Vulnerability Detail
Original operational flow:
1) User approves USDT amount to `GeneralRepay`;
2) User calls `repayJUSD()` with custom params;
3) Swap is going (USDT->USDC);
4) `jusdBank.repay()` is going. If surplus appeats at contract, it is going to borrower.

Attack vector:
1) User approves USDT amount to `GeneralRepay`;
2) Attacker either frontrun user-call `repayJUSD()` or backrun user `approve()`. Main point - after user-call `approve()` and before user-call  `repayJUSD() with such flow:
3) Attacker deploys `fakeUSDT` and gives approve `10 fakeUSDT` to `GeneralRepay`. Aim - execute `safeTransfer()` and to dive in `if (asset != USDC) {` block.
4) Attacker sends `1 USDC`  directly to `GeneralRepay`. Aim - execute `jusdBank.repay()` (no way with `0`);
5) Attacker calls `deposit()` at `jusdBank` at 10 USDC
6) Attacker calls `borrow()` at `jusdBank` let's say 3 USDC. Aim - `getBorrowBalance(to)` should return attacker balance `!=0`;
7) Attacker calls `repayJUSD()`, with such params (asset,amount,to,param) = (fakeUSDT, 10*decimals, attacker address,  swapTarget = USDT contract, data = `transferFrom`. As a result approved USDT amount by user to this contract is going to `swapTarget` (address controlled by attacker).

To not revert this tx other code must be executed. This is why attacker deposit USDC here and called  `borrow()` before.

8) Attacker dive to block ` if (USDCAmount <= borrowBalance) { ` because `1 USDC <= 3 USDC`.
9) buyJUSD() is calling and `1 USDC` is swapped to `1 JUSD`;
10) `repay()` is calling, `1 JUSD` was repayed.
As a result of attack, user asset's was stolen and were send to attacker address.

## Impact
Asset's which user approved to this contract can be lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Need to add variable swapTarget to storage, if necessary team could add 2 or more targets for swap (uni/sushi/custom) but controlled by JoJo team.
