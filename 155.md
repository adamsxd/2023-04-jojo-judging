# In case if price of bought paper is 0, then seller doesn't receive credit for it, but loses paper

## Summary
In case if price of bought paper is 0, then seller doesn't receive credit for it, but loses paper. Malicious trade executor can make loses for paper sellers, by executing trades with small amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
`JOJOExternal.approveTrade` function is called by perpetual in order to validate trade. This trade is initiated by trade executor and he is responsible for providing trading data, such as orders, signatures and amount of sold papers.

`JOJOExternal.approveTrade` makes different checks and it [calls `Trading._matchOrders`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol#L169-L174) in order to calculate paper/credit changes for participants of the trade.

One of the things that `Trading._matchOrders` does is to calculate paper and credit changes for the order's signer.

```solidity
                int256 paperChange = orderList[i].paperAmount > 0
                    ? SafeCast.toInt256(matchPaperAmount[i])
                    : -1 * SafeCast.toInt256(matchPaperAmount[i]);
                int256 creditChange = (paperChange *
                    orderList[i].creditAmount) / orderList[i].paperAmount;
```

Here you can see that `orderList[i].creditAmount / orderList[i].paperAmount` is the price of paper that is provided in the order and `paperChange` is amount that will be bought from this order. This param is controlled and provided by trading executor.
So in case if `(paperChange * orderList[i].creditAmount) / orderList[i].paperAmount == 0`, that means that seller will loose `paperChange` amount of paper, but will not receive any `creditChange` for that. This is actually very possible in case when paper token is more costly than credit token, so `orderList[i].creditAmount / orderList[i].paperAmount < 0`. Then another trades can create small orders to make loses for oposite traders.
## Impact
Trading participant loses funds.

In case if `(paperChange * orderList[i].creditAmount) / orderList[i].paperAmount == 0`, then revert.
