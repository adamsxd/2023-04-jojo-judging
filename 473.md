# Liquidator can steal collateral by taking a loan from the liquidated user.

## Summary

A liquidator can steal parts or all of the remaining collateral in a liquidation if the liquidated user is offering loans on a P2P lending market.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user is liquidated the remaining collateral is sent to the liquidated user. 

This is enforced in `JUSDBank#liquidate()`:
```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated) -
                primaryLiquidatedAmount >=
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
```

`liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` is the value of the remaining collateral after their debt has been completely repaid. This can be seen in `JUSDBank#_calculateLiquidateAmount()`:
```solidity
function _calculateLiquidateAmount(
	...
	...
	...
uint256 liquidateAmount = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(
            JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate
        );
        uint256 JUSDBorrowed = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);

        if (liquidateAmount <= JUSDBorrowed) {
			...
			...
			...
        } else {
insuranceFeeRate)
            liquidateData.actualCollateral = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalDiv(priceOff)
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
            liquidateData.insuranceFee = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalMul(reserve.insuranceFeeRate) 
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate)
            liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
            liquidateData.actualLiquidated = JUSDBorrowed;
        }

        liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC = (amount - //@audit accountfor fee?
            liquidateData.actualCollateral).decimalMul(price);
    }
```

Assuming the liquidated user is offering loans on a P2P lending market the liquidator could take out a loan before the liquidation to decrease the USDC balance of the liquidated user.

The liquidator will have deployed their own contract that adheres to the `IFlashLoanReceive` abi. In this contract, the loan is repaid which will increase the USDC balance of the liquidated user. The contract will function as the FlashLoanLiquidate contract with the difference that it repays the loan and sends parts or all of the remaining USDC to the attacker.

If the loan > `liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` the contract will steal all of the remaining USDC otherwise it will steal a value equal to the loan. The liquidator will pass the require statement by repaying the loan and stealing parts or all of the remaining USDC.

The cost of the attack is the interest on the loan which can be negligible. 

## Impact

Liquidators can steal from users with unsafe positions if they are offering loans on a P2P lending platform. Parts or all of their remaining collateral can be stolen.

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation

Remove the dependency on the USDC balance of the liquidated user. Add new functionality to allow liquidators to deposit USDC into the JUSDBank (or another separate contract) and allow liquidators to pull those funds out. The change in the amount deposited this way should govern if enough has been sent to the liquidated user.
