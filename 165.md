# Contract name is reused

## Summary
Because the codebase has two contracts with the same names, the compilation artifacts will not contain one of the contracts with the duplicate name.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract name EmergencyOracle.sol is re-used:
	- EmergencyOracle (lsmart-contract-EVM/contracts/adaptor/emergencyOracle.sol#13-49)
	- EmergencyOracle (JUSDV1/src/oracle/EmergencyOracle.sol#13-49)
## Impact
The contract name called EmergencyOracle.sol is used twice as the same contract name in 2 contracts in both the smart-contract-EVM folder and the JUSDV1 folder. 

## Code Snippet
