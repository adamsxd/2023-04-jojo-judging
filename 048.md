The `to` address can be blacklisted by a malicious actor when collateral is USDC

Some tokens like USDC can blacklist users

## Impact
When the `to` address is blacklisted he will be unable to receive funds via the `_withdraw() function` when his collateral is USDC, therefore his funds will be stuck.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
there should be functionality for the user to change the address that should receive his funds
so if his USDC address get blacklisted he can withdraw to another address
