# Reinitializing reserve can bring contract into unwanted state

## Summary
Admin trying to reinitialize a reserve can bring a contract into an unwanted state.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an owner decides that he wants to delist the reserve he will call the ```delistReserve``` seen below. This will change three variables:
1. ```reserve.isBorrowAllowed``` set to false
2. ```reserve.isDepositAllowed``` set to false
3. ```reserve.isFinalLiquidation``` set to true

Obviously, the protocol shouldn't exist in the state where all of three parameters are ```true``` at the same time. But this state can be achieved if owner calls the ```initReserve``` again with the same address for the reserve. Looking at the code below we can see that invoking this function will set the ```isDepositAllowed```  and ```isBorrowAllowed``` of the reserve to ```true```, while also having an ```isFinalLiquidation``` set to true from the previous call to the ```delistReserve```.

The contract is in the state where users can deposit the delisted collateral and borrow against it as the ```_maxMintAmountBorrow``` invoked in the ```_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow``` function will pass as borrowing is allowed. 

As soon as the users borrow against that collateral they can be liquidated as the ```_isStartLiquidation``` invoked in the ```liquidate``` function will return true. The following if will be true and the return value will always be true if this is their only collateral.
```solidity
if (reserve.isFinalLiquidation) {
    continue;
}
```

## Impact
Can let users deposit the delisted reserve and make them liquidatable instantly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a check if the reserve was already initialized thus preventing the contract getting into the above described state.
