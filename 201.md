# Improper initialization in Subaccount.sol

## Summary
The init function does not have any access control mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
Assume Alice is an attacker, she can call init() to register any address first (e.g Bob's address), when someone really need to init() bob address, they cannot do it.

The main vulnerability in the init function is that an attacker like Alice can call the init function before the intended owner or user (e.g., Bob) and set the owner variable to any address (including Bob's address). Once the init function has been called and the initialized variable is set to true, any subsequent calls to the init function will fail due to the require(!initialized, "ALREADY INITIALIZED") condition.

## Impact
The intended owner might lose opportunities to manage their risk and positions effectively, as they won't be able to use the contract properly with their desired address.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent someone from initializing the address before the intended user, add an access control mechanism to the init() function.
