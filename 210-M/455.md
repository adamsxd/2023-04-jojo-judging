# Delisted collaterals are also liquidated

## Summary

Delisted collaterals can also be taken out by liquidators.

## Vulnerability Detail

Collaterals which get de-listed are not used anymore for calculating the health factor, or the collateral amount. In all functions, they are skipped as shown.

This prevents the delisted assets from being part of the lending-borrowing process. However, if an account is unhealthy, the liquidator can still claim all of the delisted assets in the account!

When carrying out liquidations, the contract does not check if the collateral is delisted or not. Thus the liquidator can call `liquidate` with the address of the delisted collateral as an argument. Even though the tokens are not used as backing, the owner of the account can still lose them to liquidations.

During liquidation, the number of tokens up for liquidation is calculated in the following function.

Here we see as long as the `getAssetPrice()` function is alive, it can even be used to pay off debt.

## Impact

Delisted collateral used to pay off debt and liquidated.
