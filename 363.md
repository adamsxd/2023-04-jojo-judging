# Ineffective heartbeat checking due to inconsistent heartbeat intervals for Oracle price feeds

## Summary

Different pairs of tokens have different heartbeat intervals for their Oracle price feeds. Using the same `heartbeatInterval` to check two tokens may lead to ineffective or always reverting when getting prices.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `ChainlinkExpandAdaptor` and `JOJOOracleAdaptor` contracts, the `updatedAt` variable is checked with `heartbeatInterval` to ensure that the price is updated timely. The heartbeatInterval is usually set to `86400s` (24 hours).

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");

However, different pairs of tokens may have different heartbeat intervals. For example:
- ETH / USD: 86400s - https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
- BTC / USD: 86400s - https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/btc-usd
- LINK / USD: 3600s - https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/link-usd
- COMP / USD: 3600s - https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/comp-usd
- USDC / USD: 86400s - https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd

For example regarding the Perpetual LinkUSDC contract, if in the `ChainlinkExpandAdaptor` for the LINK and USDC pair, 
- if the `heartbeatInterval` is set to 86400s, the checking will be useless for LINK pricefeed since its heartbeat is 3600s.
- if the `heartbeatInterval` is set to 3600s, the getMarkPrice() function will be reverted because USDC has heartbeat of 86400s

For example, in the Perpetual LinkUSDC contract, if the `ChainlinkExpandAdaptor` for the LINK and USDC pair uses the same `heartbeatInterval`:
- If the heartbeatInterval is set to 86400s, the check for LINK price feed will be useless since its heartbeat is 3600s.
- If the heartbeatInterval is set to 3600s, the `getMarkPrice()` function will fail because USDC has a heartbeat of 86400s.

Using the same variable `heartbeatInterval` to check for both price feeds does not work.

## Impact

The price results from Oracle in function `getMarkPrice()` may return stale or incorrect prices or always revert.

## Recommendation

Use different `heartbeatInterval` for each token in the Oracle adapter contract.
