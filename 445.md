# Checking if an account is safe (e.g. after borrow) could provide wrong collateral value

## Summary
Checking collateral value to see if it matches amount of JUSD borrowed <=1:1 incorrectly checks USDC value instead of true value. 
In case of a depeg of USDC, collateral value returned could be less or higher than actual collateral value. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`_isAccountSafe` and `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` eventually call `_getMintAmount` or `_getMintAmountBorrow`
The value returned by these is scaled /USDC, meaning the price of the collateral is the /USDC value and not the true value. 

If USDC depegs to 0.8 or 1.2, collateral value does not represent the true collateral value that a user holds. This could lead to incorrect liquidations or the opposite. 
## Impact
Positions can be liquidated when they should not or the opposite
