# Changing the `borrowFeeRate` changes the fees user pay for already borrowed JUSD

## Summary
If the bank changes the `borrowFeeRate` all users that have already borrowed JUSD will pay the new `borrowFeeRate` starting from the time of the change. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user borrows JUSD he expects to pay the `borrowFeeRate` that is set when he borrows the JUSD. But if the `borrowFeeRate` is changed after he borrows JUSD he will pay the new fee on his already borrowed JUSD.
This can lead to irritations of the user since he expects to pay the borrow fee rate active when borrowing his JUSD. Also this can lead to higher than expected cost for the user in case the new borrow rate is higher than the initial one and might lead to him leaving the JOJO ecosystem. 



## Impact

Letâ€™s assume a user borrows 100 JUSD with the current borrowing rate being 2%. He wants to repay the 100 JUSD after 2 years and expects to need to repay 104 JUSD. 
1 year after he borrowed the 100 JUSD the bank changed the `borrowFeeRate` from 2% to 5% and therefore after 2 years he needs to repay 107 JUSD instead of 104 JUSD. This are higher cost for the loan than the user expected and can result in the user leaving the Jojo ecosystem to go to a place where the fees are fixed once the loan is issued.

## Recommendation

To ensure that the borrowing fee of a loan a user is taking out stays the same even if the borrowing fee is changed there could be an array of loans for each user. Each loan could be a struct that holds the loan amount, the time the loan was taken and the borrowing fee at the time the loan was taken.

In the case it is intended by the developers that a new borrowing fee is applied to all old loans, it would be useful to implement a time lock for changing the `borrowFeeRate` so the user has time to repay his loans in case he does not like the new borrowing fee.
