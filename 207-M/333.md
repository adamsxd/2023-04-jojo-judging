# Funding rates of all perpetuals can be crippled and make asset prices excessively volatile

## Summary
The `updateFundingRate()` logic can make arbitrage too accessible and also make asset prices excessively volatile

## Vulnerability Detail

Relevant parts of the logic:

- If funding rate for a perpetual exceeds a certain amount, `updateFundingRate()` will revert.
``require(
                (rateList[i] - oldRate).abs() <= maxChange,
                "FUNDING_RATE_CHANGE_TOO_MUCH"
            );``

- This revert applies to all perpetuals in the JOJO exchange, not only the offending perp. 

I understand the require statement is a feature designed to prevent funding rate abuse, and will prevent a variety of attacks under normal circumstances. However when a coin is heavily speculated on, its funding rate can easily exceed a limit that would normally be appropriate. 

I provide one scenario which can stop funding rate for changing for some time and cause excessive price volatilty.

### A highly speculative event in crypto moves funding rates too quickly
Suppose JOJO was available around the LUNA debacle and LUNA was listed.

On Binance, the LUNA/USDT perpetual contract had a funding rate of 0.01% at 12:00 UTC on December 4, 2021, but it spiked to 0.17% at 16:00 UTC and then dropped to -0.15% at 20:00 UTC. That's a 17x followed by nearly 100x change in funding rate. By comparison a number from 1-5 is given as a reference multiplier in the comments.

#### Explaining how funding arbitrage works
Assume that users on JOJO would speculate in a similar pattern to Binance at the time and funding rates would move at a similar rate. After 8 hours we have a 15x change in funding rate causing the `require()` statement to revert with "FUNDING_RATE_CHANGE_TOO_MUCH", and will be left with funding rates of:
Binance: -0.15%
JOJO: 0.01%
Assume market sentiment is growing in this negative funding rate direction on Binance and the rates are going to remain extremely negative or go down even more. For the next 8 hours, a user could go short on JOJO (the "borrowing" leg) and long the same amount on Binance (the "lending" leg), profiting 0.14% before transaction fees. 

#### Damage caused
A user could profit the difference in funding rates by going long/short the "borrowing" leg in JOJO and taking the opposite side with the "lending" leg on Binance. When users are incentivized to do this on JOJO, a positive feedback loop is created [^1] and JOJO's calculated change in funding rate is further increased, exacerbating the problem because `updateFundingRate()` will keep reverting for the offending perp and every other perp.

Taking this a step further, when "every other perp" is prevented from updating their funding rate, some more arbitrage opportunities can also present themselves, where there would be none if funding rate was free to change! Suppose these opportunities are in "normal" markets without any impetus like LUNA. In this case market forces would bring rates in the other exchange (not JOJO) back to 0.01% or whatever the reference rate is. The longer funding rates across the board remain crippled, the more chances there are for a new funding arb opportunity to arise. It is possible for one major market event to produces numerous aftershocks in the JOJO protocol funding mechanism, crippling it for even longer.

At some point in time, an equilibrium will be established. Because funding rate cannot move, price will move instead. And that is why prices will be excessively volatile relative to the broad market.

[^1]: Positive feedback loop is created because the "borrowing" leg has two properties. It follows overall sentiment in a market, being an imbalance in longs or shorts. It also is the direction that a profitable arb will result in. Incentives are skewed in this direction and without any other market impetuses there is no reason for funding rate to go back to normal.

## Impact
The funding mechanism will no longer serve its intended purpose of keeping perpetual contracts close to spot price.

## Recommendation

Allow a perp's funding rate to change by the amount `maxChange` instead of reverting the whole `updateFundingRate()` call.
