# The waiting time for a withdrawal can be bypassed

## Summary
`Funding.executeWithdraw` can be called directly by calling `requestWithdraw` before having any funds
## Vulnerability Detail
Due to the off-chain system, it is required to have a waiting period before an actual withdrawal  can be performed.

Since the off-chain system is barley documented, it's not possible to explain what this exactly means.
This does mean that it's possible to bypass this requirement which could lead to vulnerabilities.

Documentation mentions that the off-chain system deallocates the funds so that there are no errors.
But, it is unclear what happens if registered funds were already 0. 

1. A user has no funds deposited and calls `requestWithdraw` for x amount
2. The user deposits x amount to use the protocol
3. User calls `executeWithdraw` to immediately receive his funds
## Impact
Withdrawal requirements can be bypassed leading to unexpected behavior in the off-chain system.

## Recommendation
Require that the user has x amount of funds already deposited before being able to request a withdrawal for the same amount of funds
