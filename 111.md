# Unhandled Chainlink revert will disrupt the usability of the protocol

## Summary
The current implementation of the Chainlink oracle might cause a DoS as the getMarkPrice() function is not wrapped inside a try-catch block.
## Vulnerability Detail
chainlinkAdaptor.sol doesn't handle a potential revert of Chainlink's latestRoundData() function. 

This might lead to DoS of important functions at a critical time of extreme market volatility, for example.

As [Chainlink docs](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/) mentions, it is possible that Chainlinkâ€™s "multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will".

Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

## Impact
ChainlinkExpandAdaptor.getMarkPrice() could revert and cause a denial of service to important functions of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The logic for getting a token's price from the Chainlink oracle data feed should be placed in the try block and there should be some fallback logic implemented in the catch block when access to the Chainlink oracle data feed is denied.
