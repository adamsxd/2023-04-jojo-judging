# No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary

Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is 
[active](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum).

Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ChainlinkExpandAdaptor.getMarkPrice() function is using IChainlink(chainlink) to get the price of asset. There is no check that the sequencer is down:

```solidity
    function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact
Stale prices, e.g. if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, would let people submit orders and if those people are also keepers, get execution prices that do not exist in reality.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to follow the code example of Chainlink:
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code

Use a [chainlink oracle](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-use-chainlink-price-feeds-on-arbitrum/#almost_done!_meet_the_l2_sequencer_health_flag) to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
