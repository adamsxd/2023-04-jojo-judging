# a maker-only / post-only order can be traded as a taker order

## Summary
a maker / post-only order can be traded as a taker order

## Vulnerability Detail
The Perp contract when called with `trade`, would send tradedata to `approveTrade` in JOJOExternal, which then call `_matchOrders` in the Trading Library.

The `_matchOrders` function would assume the first trade in the TradeList as the taker order, and charge the specified taker fee by matching it with the rest orders as maker order. 

However, the order signer cannot express his/her will to execute this order as a post-only order. Since there is no way to do it on the order which he/she signs.  A malicious sender can execute his/her order like a taker order even though his intention is to execute like a maker-only order. 

```solidity
    struct Order {
        // address of perpetual market
        address perp;
        /*
            Signer is trader, the identity of trading behavior,
            whose balance will be changed.
            Normally it should be an EOA account and the 
            order is valid only if the signer signed it.
            If the signer is a contract, it must implement
            isValidPerpetualOperator(address) returns(bool).
            The order is valid only if one of the valid operators
            is an EOA account and signed the order.
        */
        address signer;
        // positive(negative) if you want to open long(short) position
        int128 paperAmount;
        // negative(positive) if you want to open long(short) position
        int128 creditAmount;
        /*

        bytes32 info;
    }
```
In the documentation, [a maker-only order is available](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/fee#maker-fee-rate-and-taker-fee-rate).

```markdown
Maker only: Indicates that the order placed by the traders must be a maker, not a taker, and the guarantee fee is the maker order fee. Please note that using a limit order does not guarantee that your order will be a maker order. If you want to ensure the order goes into the order book before filling, please select “Post only” when placing your order.
```

## Impact
a maker / post-only order can be traded as a taker order by malicious sender
