# Using contract USDC balance to check received amount may not be accurate

## Summary
Using contract USDC balance to check received amount may not be accurate

## Vulnerability Detail
See the following snippet in FlashLoanLiquidate#JOJOFlashLoan and #FlashLoanRepay#JOJOFlashLoan

```solidity
IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
        if (success == false) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }

        uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
```

The last USDCAmount variable represents the whole USDC amount balance in the contract. The value should be the USDC amount received from ```swapTarget.call(data)```
        
## Impact

See 
FlashLoanLiquidate#JOJOFlashLoan

```soldiity
    IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(
            liquidator,
            USDCAmount -
                liquidateData.insuranceFee -
                liquidateData.actualLiquidated -
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC
        );
```

And

#FlashLoanRepay#JOJOFlashLoan
```solidity
IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);
```

Let say a user accidentally send USDC balance to the contract, the first user who call the JOJOFlashLoan function will receive all the USDC balance

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of retrieving USDC amount from contract, 

Check the balance before and after calling this line
```(bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);```

The correct USDC amount should be the substation of both values
