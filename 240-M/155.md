# Function `getLiquidateCreditAmount` will revert or return 0 on any long position, making it so liquidation will not be possible

## Summary
The function `getLiquidateCreditAmount`  from `Liquidation.sol` will revert every time on long positions since the last `price` calculation will overflow.
## Vulnerability Detail
The liquidation process will start by calling `requestLiquidation`  which calls `getLiquidateCreditAmount` to get the `liqtorPaperChange`, `liqtorCreditChange`, `insuranceFee` variables. The function `getLiquidateCreditAmount` gets the `brokenPaperAmount` from the `Perpetual` contract, which is a returns a positive value if the trader holds a long or negative if the trader holds a short position. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/intf/IPerpetual.sol#L9-L13
Then it gets the `price` from the `MarkPriceSource` which is an 1e18 based decimal number https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/intf/IMarkPriceSource.sol#L9-L11 and calculates the `priceOffset` with the price from the `MarkPriceSource` multiplying it with `params.liquidationPriceOff` which is another 1e18 based decimals https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Types.sol#L96-L101 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L312
In the case where the `liqtorPaperChange` is positive, which happens if the trader holds a long position, the new `price` will be the old `price` - `priceOffset` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L313-L315 but this will almost always revert since the `price` will always be a lower value number than `priceOffset`, so the substraction will always overflow. The only time when it will not overflow is when both values are equal which will get the new `price` value equal to 0, and almost every other variable in the function that uses the new `price` value will be also 0 because of multiplication/division with 0.
## Impact
This can have a high impact to the project since the liquidation of a long position will not be possible almost every time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the logic of the way the new price is calculated or use int256 instead of uint256 so the subtractions will not overflow.
