# `approveTrade()` can be frontrun to steal order sender fee by other valid order sender

## Summary
Even though currently, JOJO is the only valid order sender currently, the protocol aims to decentralise matching mechanism in the future, hence adding more order senders in the future.

When that happens, `approveTrade()` becomes a race condition as the caller can frontrun `trade()` and receive the order sender fee instead.

## Vulnerability Detail
`approveTrade()` takes in only 2 parameters, `orderSender` and `tradeData`. All users signature are saved in `tradeData` and transparent on the blockchain. An adversary can frontrun `trade()`, use the same `tradeData`, and hence be the recipient of order sender fee.

## Impact
Order sender fee can be stolen by malicious order sender

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding `orderSender` as part of the signature used in `tradeData` if we want to limit who is allowed to collect fees, instead of enabling all valid order senders.
