# A User Cannot Withdraw funds in many cases due to Heartbeat interval requirement

## Summary

The function withdraw allows a user to withdraw their funds after depositing them into the JUSD bank. However the function has
a requirement that if the difference between the heartbeat interval and the block.timestamp is too large then the function will revert, causing funds to be locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

The function withdraw allows a user to withdraw their funds. In order to complete the transaction, the function checks whether the account if safe shown here

In the function _isAccountsafe, the function checks for a variable _maxMintAmount

_maxmintamount checks for a variable _getMintamount which is calculated by using the chainlink oracle

So if for example, the heartbeat interval is set at 86400 (1 day), the function withdraw will revert if block.timestamp - updatedAt is greater than 1 day.









## Impact

User funds could be locked

## Recommendation
A possible mitigation would be to use the emergency oracle if the chainlink oracle returns a stale price
