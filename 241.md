# Liquidation reverts when amount > liquidated balance

## Summary
When calculating liquidate amount in JUSDBank, it is required that amount is less than liquidated.depositBalance. However, liquidated.depositBalance could be reduced by as little as 1 GWEI during liquidation before the transaction is finally mined.

## Vulnerability Detail
An address with bad intention (e.g attacker or liquidated using a different address) could use this check to frontrun legitimate liquidation. Instead of taking the collateral, they would give the legitimate liquidator a bad experience. Reverts could discourage legitimate liquidators cause they might think the account has been liquidated already. DoS might be temporary but it's cheap to replicate again and again. And when prices are moving fast, lead to bad debt for the insurance.

## Impact
A position is not liquidated at all, or not liquidated fast enough, leading to bad debt for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rather than revert, set amount and add it to the returned liquidateData
```sol
liquidateData.amount = amount <=  liquidatedInfo.depositBalance[collateral] 
    ? amount
    : liquidatedInfo.depositBalance[collateral]
```
The `liquidateData.amount` would then be used in place of `amount` in `_calculateLiquidateAmount`, `liquidate`, and `_afterLiquidateOperation` functions.
