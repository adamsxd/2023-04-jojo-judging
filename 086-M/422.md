# Nonce is not checked on-chain

## Summary

The known issues says `Signature can be replayed: Backend will add nonce to the order type to prevent replay attacks.`

But the order nonce is not checked on-chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

This allows orders with the same nonce to be executed on-chain.

I suspect the backend checks the nonce but the backend needs to maintain nonce database records. The backend takes the responsbility of maintain the integrate of the db and this is not the web3 way.

## Impact

Replay is still possible if the backend does not check the nonce or the backend loses nonce records.

## Code Snippet

Order has a nonce field.

But the nonce is not checked during order validation in `approveTrade`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Record and check nonce on-chain.
