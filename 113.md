# [H-02] DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol has no access control. Attacker can steal user's approved funds.

## Summary
Purpose of `DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol` to help users swap their assets to USDC and deposit USDC to `JOJODealer`.
Due to presence `safeTransferFrom()` in `depositStableCoin()` user must approve assets(e.g. USDT) to this contract before call `depositStableCoin()`;



## Vulnerability Detail
Original operational flow:
1) User approves USDT amount to `DepositStableCoinToDealer`;
2) User calls `depositStableCoin()`;
3) Swap is going (USDT->USDC);
4) `IDealer(JOJODealer).deposit(USDCAmount, 0, to)` is going;

Attack vector:
1) User approves USDT amount to `DepositStableCoinToDealer`;
2) Attacker either frontrun user-call `depositStableCoin()` or backrun user `approve()`. Main point - between user approve and after call  `depositStableCoin();
3) Attacker deploys `fakeUSDC` and gives approve `10 fakeUSDC` to `DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol`. Aim - bypass `safeTransfer()`;
4) Attacker sends `1 USDC`  directly to `DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol`. Aim - bypass `JOJODealer.deposit()`;
5) Attacker calls `depositStableCoin()`, put in `swapTarget`  field USDC address and put in `data` field `transferFrom(user,attacker,usdcToStealAmount)`;  
As a result approved USCD amount by user to this contract is going to `swapTarget` (address controlled by attacker).
6) `1 USDC` is deposited to JoJoDealer
7) User tx reverted (call `depositStableCoin()`) due the insufficient USDC balance. 

## Impact
Asset's which user approved to this contract can be lost.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Need  to add variable  `swapTarget` to storage, if necessary team could add 2 or more targetsfor swap (uni/sushi/custom) but controlled by JoJo team.
