## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious market maker can take advantage of a wide bid–ask spread in the order book of a low liquidity market where the `indexPrice` falls within that spread. By strategically placing bid and ask orders within the spread, the market maker can manipulate the `midPrice` `indexPrice` bias to controll the funding rate.

## Impact

Malicious user can manipluate the funding rate of a low liquidity market.
