# Missing input validation in emergencyOracle.setMarkPrice

## Summary

The setMarkPrice function in emergencyOracle contract is missing input validation which allows the owner to set any value to the price variable, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail

The setMarkPrice function allows the owner to set the price of the oracle. However, there is no input validation on the newPrice parameter, which means that the owner can set any value to the price variable. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the system as the price variable is used in other functions for calculations, and if it is set to an unexpected value, it can cause financial loss.

## Impact

The vulnerability can potentially lead to financial loss as the owner can set any value to the price variable, which is used in other functions for calculations. An attacker can set a malicious value to the price variable and potentially cause unexpected behavior in the system, leading to financial loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this vulnerability, the setMarkPrice function should include input validation to ensure that the newPrice parameter is within an acceptable range. Additionally, it is recommended to use a library that provides safe math operations to avoid integer overflows and underflows.
