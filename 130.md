# IChainLinkAggregator.latestRoundData response has no check for round completeness

## Summary

IChainLinkAggregator.latestRoundData response has no check for round completeness. No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

`JOJOOracleAdaptor` and `ChainlinkExpandAdaptor` use the chainlink oracle to calculate the current price of tokens used to calculate collateral price, liquidation amount and threshold, borrow amount, mark price of a perpetual market, and other important values of the system. 

The issue is that the return value of `IChainLinkAggregator.latestRoundData` is not properly validated. Although the returned timestamp is checked, there is no check for round completeness.

According to Chainlink's documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external Chainlink oracle, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

## Impact

If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

As a result, the functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss, such as users being liquidated when they should not or no liquidation performed when there should be, or inaccurate price for collaterals, among others.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Validate data feed for round completeness:

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        (uint80 roundID, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (uint80 usdcRoundId, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,uint80 usdcAnsweredInRound) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
        require(usdcAnsweredInRound >= usdcRoundID, "round not complete");

        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
