# Incorrect Credit Calculation in Perpetual#_settle: Price of Asset Overlooked

## Summary

The Perpetual#_settle miss to consider the Price of the underlying asset when calculating credit. This omits a critical factor in the calculation, resulting in inaccurate credit.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the perpetual system The funding rate is applied to the notional value of the position, i.e., the contract size times the price of the asset, not just the contract size. This vulnerability can be broken down into the following steps:

- Assume a trader already has a long position at a price of 25,000:
 
```solidity
balance {
        int128 paper = 2;
        int128 reducedCredit = -50,000;
    }
```

- If the trader goes long on 1BTC at 30,000USD:
 
```solidity
balance {
        int128 paper = 1;
        int128 reducedCredit = -30,000;
    }
```

- while opening a trade after matching orders last step is _settle, 
- The _settle function calculates the credit as follows:

```solidity
        int256 credit = int256(balanceMap[trader].paper).decimalMul(rate) +
            int256(balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit) +
            creditChange;

```
```diff
 credit = 2 * fundingRate - 50,000 - 30,000
```

In this function, the funding rate is directly applied to the number of contracts (balanceMap[trader].paper) held by the trader, rather than the notional value of the position (contract size * price of the asset).


## Impact

Traders could be charged incorrect funding fees, which could lead to potential losses or unjust gains. This could result in a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The _settle function should be modified to include the price of the asset in the credit calculation. The correct credit calculation should be as follows:

```diff
 credit = 2 * fundingRate * Price - 50,000 - 30,000
```
