# DOS in liquidate() function.

## Summary
In liquidate() function, the collateral balance of the liquidated user is retrieved directly from their wallet balance instead of the deposited balance in the protocol. This can lead to incorrect calculations and unintended behaviour during the liquidation process.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 primaryLiquidatedAmount = IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(
            liquidated
        );
```
The primary asset balance of the liquidated user is retrieved using IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated). This returns the balance of the primary asset (in this case, USDC) held by the liquidated user directly in their wallet, which might not accurately represent the collateral that they have deposited into the protocol.


## Impact
```solidity
require( 
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated) -
                primaryLiquidatedAmount >=
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
```
This vulnerability can lead to incorrect calculations during the liquidation process, If the liquidated user doesn't have any primary asset, require block always fails and liquidation can not happen.
