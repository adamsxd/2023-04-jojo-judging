# no check for removed collateral

## Summary

there is no check if the collateral that the user want to add is active or removed, this may cause sending removed collateral to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

i talked to the team of the protocol and they said `It is not paused JUSD protocol . Just can not deposit this collateral and its value is considered to be zero so that users can not borrow JUSD by this collateral` that mean the collateral that is removed should not allow to add or send it to the protocol by calling deposit function, but there is no check for if the collateral is removed or not !

the deposit function will call `JUSDBank.sold#_deposit`which contain all the logic of the function:

```solidity

function _deposit(
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve,
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from
    ) internal {
        require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);
        user.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
        reserve.totalDepositAmount += amount;
        require(
            user.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
        );
        require(
            reserve.totalDepositAmount <= reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_TOTAL
        );
        emit Deposit(collateral, from, to, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

there is no check for removed/unActive collateral in the protocol lead to bad scenario happen.

## Tool used

manual review

## Recommendation

recommend to add check if the collateral is removed or not, something like this or same logic as aave-protocol v2 :

```solidity

require(isCollateralActive, ""the collateral is removed"")

```
