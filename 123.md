# Lack of access control in FlashloanRepay, FlashloanLiquidate, GeneralRepay, and DepositStableCoinToDealer can lead to user loss of funds

## Summary

Functions implemented on [`FlashloanRepay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanRepay.sol#L40), [`FlashloanLiquidate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L51), [`GeneralRepay`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/GeneralRepay.sol), and [`DepositStableCoinToDealer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/stableCoin/DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol#L29) lack proper access control, which can allow any address to execute them passing arbitrary parameters, leading to user loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The contracts `FlashloanRepay`, `FlashloanLiquidate`, `GeneralRepay` are trying to implement JOJO teams product functionality. `FlashloanRepay` is trying to repay JUSD by using the deposited collateral. `FlashloanLiquidate` is trying to implement the liquidation of JOJO team. `GeneralRepay` is trying to repay JUSD by using the collateral in usersâ€™ wallet. `DepositStableCoinToDealer` is trying to deposit USDC to the JOJODealer. 

However, the functions `FlashloanRepay.JOJOFlashLoan`, `FlashloanRepay.JOJOFlashLoan`, and `GeneralRepay.JOJOFlashLoan` do not validate that the caller is the `JUSDBank`, and `DepositStableCoinToDealer.depositStableCoin` do not validate if the caller is the contract owner.

This means any address can call these functions passing arbitrary parameters, which can lead to user loss of funds. 

Since all these functions contain a low-level call to an user-controlled contract, it is possible, for example, to call `transfer` or `approve` to any ERC20 tokens by constructing an encoded `param` that decodes to the `swapTarget` token and the calldata `data` to execute these functions.

```solidity
 (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
```

For example, a malicious attacker can call `FlashLoanRepay.JOJOFlashLoan` passing a `param` that decodes to `swapTarget` equals to `USDC` and `data` that is the calldata for `approve` or `transfer`. 

```solidity
    function JOJOFlashLoan(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes calldata param
    ) external {
        (address approveTarget, address swapTarget, uint256 minReceive, bytes memory data) = abi
            .decode(param, (address, address, uint256, bytes));
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
```

The steps to reproduce this exploit on the other contracts are similar, as they all have a `(bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);` to an user-controlled `data` input.

This exploit depends on the rest of the functions not reverting, which means it has some preconditions. For example, for `FlashLoanRepay.sol`, calling `IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getBorrowBalance` and `IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD`, and `IJUSDBank(jusdBank).repay` must not revert. The first two do not contain checks, but the third one requires that [`require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.REPAY_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L314), which means that it will only succeed in the case hte user has some debt. 

Because this exploit contains preconditions but can lead to user loss of funds, the severity is set to MEDIUM.

### Note

This is a different vulnerability from what is considered "out of scope" as per the project README:

> 17. FlashloanRepay, FlashloanLiquidate, GeneralRepay aare only implemented for functional purposes, regardless of accidental transfers by users.

As the [project sponsor](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1100073679762755625/1102781821894270996) confirmed, only accidental function calls by users are considered out of scope:

> Which means if users wrongly construct the param or transfer wrong token to this address. We are sorry about this but can not do anything. In these three cases, we only execute the remaining USDC.

## Impact

Contracts deployed following FlashloanRepay, FlashloanLiquidate, GeneralRepay, and DepositStableCoinToDealer implementation, without proper access control, may lead to user loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require that `msg.sender` is equal to the `jusdBank` on FlashloanRepay, FlashloanLiquidate, GeneralRepay, and that `msg.sender` is equal to `owner` on the third contract (it must also implement `Ownable`)
