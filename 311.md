# potential economic issues with JUSD

## Summary
- `JUSDExchange` relies on that the protoocol continuously feed JUSD.
- There might be situations where they cannot keep up with demand which could lead to the price of JUSD increasing.
- `JUSDExchange` is potentially a source for non collateral backed JUSD.
- `JUSDBank` relies on protocol continuously feeding JUSD.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `JUSDExchange` you can trade JUSD for USDC:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDExchange.sol#L41-L46
```solidity
File: JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDExchange.sol

41:    function buyJUSD(uint256 amount, address to) external {
42:        require(isExchangeOpen, JUSDErrors.NOT_ALLOWED_TO_EXCHANGE);
43:        IERC20(primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), amount);
44:        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransfer(to, amount);
45:        emit BuyJUSD(amount, to, msg.sender);
46:    }
```

This requires the owners (or anyone) to put JUSD into `JUSDExchange`. Given that there is JUSD in the contract this will work to keep the price of JUSD at 1 USDC or below.

It might however cause the price of JUSD to drop below 1 USDC since if the protocol mints JUSD directly into the exchange there will be non-collateral backed JUSD out in the world.

Also, when borrowing, the `JUSDBank` needs to have JUSD available in it:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L288-L293
```solidity
File: JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol

288:        if (isDepositToJOJO) {
289:            IERC20(JUSD).approve(address(JOJODealer), tAmount);
290:            IDealer(JOJODealer).deposit(0, tAmount, to);
291:        } else {
292:            IERC20(JUSD).safeTransfer(to, tAmount);
293:        }
```

This requires the protocol to mint JUSD outside and then transfer in and having a buffer, which are un-backed JUSD.

## Impact
Handling of `JUSDExchange` is delicate since it could dilute the marked with non-collateral backed JUSD. For JUSD to keep its value it is very important that it has collateral backing.

## Recommendation
All JUSD in `JUSDExchange` must be backed by loans and cannot be minted directly for the exchange.
