# A user can receive JUSD without initially depositing collateral

## Summary
Since `JUSDBank.borrow` does not perform necessary checks in the right order, it's possible to borrow JUSD without initially depositing collateral. Leaving the user a free position in JUSDBank
## Vulnerability Detail
This can be achieved by performing the following:
1. A user uses a contract without any deposited collateral and calls `borrow` for an x amount which is lower than `maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` and  `maxTotalBorrowAmount`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L105-L117
2. This initiates the first part of the function which is call `_borrow` to transfer the inputted amount in JUSD
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L274-L292
3. Assuming JUSD is >= $1, on receive, the user's contract sells the amount of JUSD for collateral that is supported by JUSBank and calls `deposit` with that collateral (optional, does for differnt collateral to make sure max collateral deposit is not reached)
4. Balance of user's contract now is amountJUSD:callateralValue
5. `_borrow` passes the require max value checks on line 296 and 301 and continues executing `borrow`
6. On line 114, `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` is called. Since we sold all of the JUSD for the same amount of value in collateral (or more assuming JUSD is >= $1) this will pass. 

The user's contract now has a free position without depositing any collateral. 
The user can sit the position out until it gets liquidated and receive a portion of that position. 

Note that even is JUSD is below $1, the user can decide to provide a little collateral himself in order to pass `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` if the potential reward from being liquidated exceeds it.

## Recommendation
This can be avoided in multiple ways.
One way is to perform the require checks before executing the rest of the function
