# Attackers can steal token from users who call erc20 approve to DepositStableCoinToDealer contract

## Summary
Attackers can steal token from users who call erc20 approve to DepositStableCoinToDealer contract
## Vulnerability Detail
According to this contract:
1. Users have to call erc20 approve before deposit a token to dealers.

2. depositStableCoin() will call to a function of 3rd party contract (both contract address and function/calldata are from user inputs).

By (1) and (2), attackers can just front-run to see if any user call approve to this contract, and then just call depositStableCoin (before the victims do) to command the contract to transfer that amount of token to their address

Consider this scenario:
A victim wants to deposit USDC to dealer, so he approves this contract to take his USDC.
An attacker sees that the victim is calling approve on-chain, so he calsl depositStableCoin() with swap target = USDC contract address and data = abi.encode("safeTransferFrom(address, address, uint256), victim_address, attacker_address, victim_amount)".
The code executes, sending victim's token to attacker's address.

## Impact
Attackers can steal tokens from users who call approve to this contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a whitelist for swap target, and avoid letting users have control over call data.
