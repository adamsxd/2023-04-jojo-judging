# Possible to steal other users tokens using FlashloanLiquidate.sol

## Summary
FlashloanLiquidate.sol has the same problem as DepositStableCoinToDealer.sol. namely, it allows users to call an arbitrary address and send it arbitrary calldata. See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-getjiggy/issues/1 for an example exploit to this code pattern. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This function allows a user to send arbitrary calldata to an arbitrary address. meaning, if any users have existing approvals balances on the contracts it can be stolen. 
## Impact
your users get rekt.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
hardcode the swap target to be an aggregator, do a calldata validation to make sure the calldata contains an appropriate function selector. You could use paraswaps AugustusSwapper, or 1inch, or 0x. Just do literally anything other than what is currently implemented.
