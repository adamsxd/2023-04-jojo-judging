# Borrowing without the intention to repay.

## Summary
There is no liquidate or does not force a loan to become default or allow the lender to claim collateral tokens directly in `repayJUSD()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In GeneralRepay.sol, there is no liquidation behavior and there is no function force a loan to become default or allow the lender to claim the collateral tokens. 
The purpose of the `repayJUSD()` function is to allow users to repay their borrowed tokens.

Example:
1. Alice receives 10 mockToken1 tokens and 1000 USDC tokens.
2. Alice deposits 10 mockToken1 tokens as collateral in the jusdBank.
3. Alice borrows 3000 USDC tokens using her deposited collateral.
4. At this point, Alice has a debt of 3000 USDC tokens, but she only has 1000 USDC tokens in her wallet.
5. Alice attempts to repay her loan of 3000 USDC tokens using the repayJUSD() function, but she only approves the transfer of 1000 USDC tokens, which is not enough to cover her debt.
6. The repayment transaction fails due to insufficient balance.
7. Alice's USDC balance remains unchanged, and her outstanding debt is still 3000 USDC tokens.

In this scenario, Alice is unable to repay her loan as she does not have enough USDC tokens in her wallet to cover the full amount of her outstanding debt. The repayJUSD() function does not force a loan to become default, allow the lender to claim collateral tokens, or trigger liquidation in this case.

## Impact
Since the lender cannot claim collateral tokens directly in the event of non-repayment, the lender might be exposed to a higher level of risk if borrowers fail to repay their loans.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism for handling loan defaults and liquidations, allowing lenders to claim collateral tokens directly when needed or add `liquidate()` in `repayJUSD()`
