# Unbounded Loop in Matching Orders

## Summary

The `_matchOrders` function in the `Trading.sol` contract uses a loop to process and match orders. This loop may result in an unbounded loop scenario, which can lead to a high gas consumption and potential denial-of-service vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Trading.sol` contract, the `_matchOrders` function iterates through the `orderList` array to process and match orders. The length of this array is not restricted, which means that a malicious user could potentially exploit this by submitting a large number of orders in a single transaction. This can lead to a high gas consumption and make the function susceptible to denial-of-service attacks.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to increased gas consumption and potential denial-of-service attacks, making it difficult for users to interact with the contract. This can have a negative impact on the usability and security of the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a limit on the maximum number of orders that can be processed in a single transaction. This will help to control the gas consumption and prevent potential denial-of-service attacks.

```solidity
uint256 constant MAX_ORDERS_PER_TRANSACTION = 50;

require(orderList.length <= MAX_ORDERS_PER_TRANSACTION, "Exceeded maximum orders per transaction");
```

Additionally, you can consider implementing a mechanism to process orders in smaller batches, allowing the processing to be more gas-efficient and less vulnerable to attacks.
