# `JUSDBank.sol#borrow` can only borrow much lower than expected

## Summary

`JUSDBank.sol#borrow` can only borrow much lower than expected

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: Impl/JUSDView.sol
130     function _isAccountSafeAfterBorrow(
131         DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
132         uint256 tRate
133     ) internal view returns (bool) {
134         return
135             user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate) <=
136             _maxMintAmountBorrow(user);
137     }
```

The `borrow` function further calls the `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` function to check whether the loan amount is legal. The problem here is that when calculating the borrowing amount, `tRate` will be multiplied, causing the user to only borrow a much smaller amount than expected.

According to the official documentation, the desired `maxBorrowAmount` is:

```text
maxBorrowAmount = sum(collateralAmount ∗ price ∗ initialMortgageRate)
```

Actual implementation:

```text
maxBorrowAmount = sum(collateralAmount ∗ price ∗ initialMortgageRate) / tRate
```

As time increases, `tRate` will become larger and larger, resulting in a smaller and smaller ratio of JUSD loan collateral.

## Impact

As a result, users can borrow less JUSD.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended not to multiply by `tRate`

```diff
    function _isAccountSafeAfterBorrow(
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        uint256 tRate
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        return
-           user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate) <=
+           user.t0BorrowBalance <=
            _maxMintAmountBorrow(user);
    }
```
