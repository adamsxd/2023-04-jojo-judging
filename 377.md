# Protocol is taking unnecessary risk by pegging itself completely to USDC

## Summary
Asset prices are priced based on USDC instead of USD. Important functions such as `borrow()`, `liquidate()` all rely on this USDC pricing instead of USD. 

## Vulnerability Detail

JUSD aims to be a multi-collateralised protocol, holding ETH,BTC etc. In the event of a temporary depeg, even if just a second, assets can be liquidated quickly, since the depegged price of USDC is used. Furthermore, the primary asset used is USDC, and JUSD can always be exchanged 1:1 with USDC. JUSD has an overreliance on USDC.

## Impact
Pegging JUSD completely to USDC means that any kind of depeg can have adverse effects on the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the actual USD price feed instead of converting them to USDC price feed. Asset prices can be measured in USD instead. Also, instead of allowing USDC to be exchanged 1:1 to JUSD, use a pricefeed to measure how much USDC can be exchange for 1 JUSD.
