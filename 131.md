# `JUSDbank.flashloan` function wouldn't work as expected

## Summary

the `JUSDbank.flashloan` function will never work as it expected because of the `_withdraw` function that called to withdraw the `amount` to the user, the flashloan should give the user/caller amounts that s/he want and the caller should pay it back in the same transcation,user will ask for a huge amount to get as flashloan and flashloan wouldn't ask for any collateral to give the protocol to get some flashloan, that's how it should work but it doesn't work like this in the JUSDbank.

## Vulnerability Detail

if user want to get some flashLoan he should call `JUSDbank.Flashloan()` function to get some flashloan, this is the implementation of the flashloan function :

```solidity
function flashLoan(
        address receiver,
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes memory param
    ) external nonFlashLoanReentrant {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];

        _withdraw(amount, collateral, receiver, msg.sender, false);
        // repay
        IFlashLoanReceive(receiver).JOJOFlashLoan(

            collateral,
            amount,
            to,
            param
        );
        require(
            _isAccountSafe(user, getTRate()),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_FLASHLOAN_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
        emit FlashLoan(collateral, amount);
    }
```

the flashLoan function will call the `_withdraw` function :

```solidity
 function _withdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from,
        bool isInternal
    ) internal {
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve = reserveInfo[collateral];
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage fromAccount = userInfo[from];
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        require(
            amount <= fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral],
            JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_TOO_BIG
        );

        fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral] -= amount;
        if (isInternal) {
            DataTypes.UserInfo storage toAccount = userInfo[to];
            _addCollateralIfNotExists(toAccount, collateral);
            toAccount.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
            require(
                toAccount.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                    reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
                JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
            );
        } else {
            reserve.totalDepositAmount -= amount;
            IERC20(collateral).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
        emit Withdraw(collateral, from, to, amount, isInternal);
        _removeEmptyCollateral(fromAccount, collateral);
    }

```

the problem is in the `_withdraw` function above which is check that amount(that user want to borrow it as flashloan) should be smaller than his deposit collateral, and this check will fail most of time because most of users will call flashloan to get hug balance and make some profit and return it back in same transction that the benefit of flashloan and flash loan logic in all defi protocols. for example

1- alice want to get some flash loan by calling `flashloan` function and adding the parameters like this :
amount = $10,000
address = any collateral address
address to = any address
address from = msg.sender which have collateral of $3000

```solidity

function FlashLoan(uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from,
        bool isInternal)

```

2- and then this function will call the `_withdraw` function which have this check :

```solidity
require(
            amount <= fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral],
            JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_TOO_BIG
        );
```

the call will revert because amount aren't less than her collateral balance(revert becuase 10,000 <= 3000) and this way she can't even have flashloan and to get some flash loan she should provide at least 10,000 worh of collateral and that is not what users want

3- this way flashloan is same as borrow logic and it is not flashloan and this is not what the protocol and the team want as i talked with the team sponser that he said : `JOJO's flashloan does not charge any fees, with no difference between our implementation and of other DeFi protocols. `

## Impact

the flashloan logic and code did not work as it expected and it will revet for most of the users

## Recommendation

i recommend to use special withdraw function that work with the flashloan logic as Aave v2 and v3 do, the team may implement the function of flashLoan like this to make sure if user the didn't repay the tokens then s/he loose his collateral, but this is not the good logic to prevent this the `require` should check if amount is less than JUSDbank so the protocol can give the user the amount without drain of protocol, i recommend to follow Aave codebase and docs to handle the both case i mentioned(flashloan never pay back and avoid drain and give the user the amount wanted)
