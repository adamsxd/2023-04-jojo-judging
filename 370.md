# Lack of access control to several functions in `Operation.sol`

## Summary

Lack of access control to several functions in `Operation.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
In [Operation.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L45-L155) contract we have several functions without access control. 
These functions are:

- `setFundingRateKeeper()`
- `setInsurance()`
- `setWithdrawTimeLock()`
- `setPerpRiskParams()`
- `updateFundingRate()`
- `setOrderSender()`
- `setOperator()`
- `setSecondaryAsset()`

The functions are external and without any modifier and anyone can call them.

## Impact

For important functions that can hurt the protocol in some way, it is important to have some access control.

## Recommendation

Add access control to these functions.
