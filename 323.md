# Withdrawal timelock can be bypassed

## Summary
An adversary can DoS the system by creating trades and withdrawing, potentially causing trades to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, withdrawals occur in two steps: a user requests a withdrawal and must wait for a timelock to expire before the withdrawal is processed. This process has been put in place to improve the success rate of settlement.

When a user requests a withdrawal, the matching engine will reduce their available balance immediately to prevent invalid matching. However, an attacker can bypass this timelock by requesting a withdrawal before making a deposit. The attacker can then make a deposit, wait for a trade match event, front-run it by withdrawing, and ultimately revert the matching block of trades.

## Impact
This gives an adversary control of when a trade goes through. If they see an unfavorable trade batch, they can call withdraw to prevent a trade from processing.

## Recommendation
Consider only allowing requestWithdraw to be called if the user has deposits.
