# Macro Stops Working if there's no more JUSD

## Summary

FlashLoan Macros for:
- Repay
- Liquidate

Use `JUSDExchange`, but the liquidity in it is dependent on how much was deposited, additionally, by definition, there will always be less liquidity than all debt available (since debt is monotonically increasing over time)

For this reason, Macros will not work in most cases as they rely on swapping from USDC to JUSD via the JUSDExchange.

## Vulnerability Detail

All macros will stop working until the owner adds more liquidity, which causes volatility risk + opportunity cost to the Owner, and makes the Macro Unusable for the average user


## Impact

Call to `buyJUSD` will revert if not enough liquidity is available, prevent the macros from working

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It may be best to allow to mint JUSD temporarily or to make the macros more open-ended
