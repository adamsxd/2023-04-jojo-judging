# JUSD should not be pegged to USDC

## Summary

JUSD should not be pegged to USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol states that 

```md
JUSD can be freely traded, however, its price is not guaranteed to be equal to Primary asset in the open market.
```

Primary asset is USDC. JUSD price is not guaranteed to be equal to USDC.

In GeneralRepay#repayJUSD, the protocol assumes that JUSD == USDC. When a user intends to repay using the repayJUSD() function, the user first deposits a certain amount of asset. If the asset is not USDC, then appropriate conversions take place to convert the asset to USDC. 

Then, the function checks the USDC amount in the contract. Then, it converts the USDCAmount to JUSD amount. The function then calls buyJUSD using the USDCAmount and call repay in JusdBank.

```solidity
        uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(USDCAmount >= minReceive, "receive amount is too small");
        uint256 JUSDAmount = USDCAmount;
```

Protocol shouldn't assume that JUSD is pegged to USDC but convert the JUSD price into USDC instead. If JUSD is $1 but USDC depegs to $0.9, then users are able to repay their loan with lesser amounts of JUSD since JUSD is treated as $0.9 instead of $1

## Impact

Accounting for borrow/repay/liquidate will not be consistent

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend calling an oracle when borrowing / repaying USDC to make sure the correct conversion of USDC -> JUSD takes place.

```solidity
        uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(USDCAmount >= minReceive, "receive amount is too small");
/// check price of JUSD , check price of USDC, and perform the appropriate conversion instead of assuming JUSD == USDC
        uint256 JUSDAmount = USDCAmount;
```
