# DIVISION BEFORE MULTIPLICATION IN `getMaxChange` function

## Summary
Division before multiplication was done in the `getMaxChange` function of  the FundingRateUpdateLimiter.sol file. The `getMaxChange` function was used in the updateFundingRate function and the precision loss from the division before multiplication would affect the validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
On line 58, the value from the first bracket was divided by `1 days` and in line 59 `maxChange` was subsequently multiplied by `markPrice`. 

function getMaxChange(address perp) public view returns (uint256) {
        Types.RiskParams memory params = IDealer(dealer).getRiskParams(perp);
        uint256 markPrice = IMarkPriceSource(params.markPriceSource).getMarkPrice();
        uint256 timeInterval = block.timestamp - fundingRateUpdateTimestamp[perp];
58:        uint256 maxChangeRate = (speedMultiplier * timeInterval * params.liquidationThreshold) / (1 days); //@audit div before mul
59:        uint256 maxChange = (maxChangeRate * markPrice) / Types.ONE;
        return maxChange;
    }
    
## Impact
Precision loss from division before multiplication may cause incorrect funding rate update.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When it involves multiplication and division, always implement multiplication before division to avoid unnecessary precision loss.
