# Safety of `updateReserveParam` is not checked, which can bring the protocol to a risky state

## Summary

`_liquidationMortgageRate` should be checked against `_initialMortgageRate` before allowing it to be changed

## Vulnerability Detail

Initial Mortgage rate may be close or higher than `_liquidationMortgageRate`, because no check is applied, this can cause the system to trigger liquidations or be in an incorrect state.

Which can break the safety parameters

InitialMortgageRate may be set improperly, which would cause:
- Borrowing too much
- Instant Liquidations

Since the value is not checked against `liquidationMortgageRate`

Additionally, the value is not checked against `liquidationPriceOff` which may cause bad debt

## Impact

All depositors may be incorrectly liquidated
