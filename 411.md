# Order sender pays trade gas fee and the cost will be huge

## Summary

Trade transactions are sent by order sender, an account managed by JOJO. 
The trade transaction gas fees are paid by order sender instead of traders.

## Vulnerability Detail

For this trading system, high volume tradings are expected which will consume JOJO 
considerable gas fees.

## Impact

Order sender pays trading gas fee and the cost will be huge.
