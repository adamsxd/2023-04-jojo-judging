# Swapping the liquidated collateral for USDC when running the JOJOFlashloan():FlashLoanLiquidate.sol is susceptible to sandwich attack which could mess up the rewards of the liquidators

## Summary
The swap performed on the [JOJOFlashloan():FlashLoanLiquidate.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L53-L70) is susceptible to sandwich attacks because there is no protection against price slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail
While the `FlashLoanRepay.sol` contract has [implemented a check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanRepay.sol#L54) to validate that the received amount out of the swap is at least the minimum specified on the parameter `minReceive`, the contract `FlashLoanLiquidate.sol` is lacking this protection, thus, making users vulnerable to unintended slippage due to slippage / sandwiching / MEV.
```solidity
function JOJOFlashLoan(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to,
    bytes calldata param
) external {
    //swapContract swap
    (LiquidateData memory liquidateData, bytes memory originParam) = abi
        .decode(param, (LiquidateData, bytes));
    (
        address approveTarget,
        address swapTarget,
        address liquidator,
        bytes memory data
    ) = abi.decode(originParam, (address, address, address, bytes));
    IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
    (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
    if (success == false) {
        assembly {
            let ptr := mload(0x40)
            let size := returndatasize()
            returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
            revert(ptr, size)
        }
    }

    uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
    // No check to enforce the received amount out of swapping the collateral is at least an specific amount of USDC

    IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, liquidateData.actualLiquidated);
    IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(
        liquidateData.actualLiquidated,
        address(this)
    );

   ...

}

```

Considering the economic incentives that liquidators get out of liquidating positions, if attackers perform sandwich attacks on these swaps and the USDC received is just enough to cover the liquidation costs, liquidating positions might not be attracted to liquidators, thus, increasing the risk for the system to not get rid off bad debts because liquidators are not participating in the liquidation process.

- Several AMMs will have a mechanism to limit slippage, but it might be useful to add a generic mechanism to prevent the system being abused by a relatively large slippage


## Impact
Attackers can perform a sandwich attack on a transaction doing a liquidation, and the value received out of swapping the collateral of the liquidated account for USDC might be lower than what it should be, which could end up being equal to barely paying the liquidation costs and leaving with no rewards to the liquidator

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to add a protection check against price slippage, similar to the one that is implemented on the `FlashLoanRepay.sol` contract!
The minAmount could be calculated right before executing the swap() on the JOJOFlashloan()
- Get the current price of the total collateral that the JOJOFlashLoan() is holding expressed in <Collateral>/USDC and use it to calculate what should be the minimum amount to receive considering all the liquidation costs and leaving rewards to the liquidator
