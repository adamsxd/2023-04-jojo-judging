# Token borrow limits can be violated with withdrawals

## Summary

Token borrow limits in JUSDBank can be violated. users can borrow 100 JUSD with collateral A, even if the max mint for collateral A was set to less than that (asy 50).

## Vulnerability Detail

When borrowing JUSD tokens, the contract has certain checks in place, which ensure certain risk limits are met.

After the borrow call is done, the account is checked for health, and this can call reverts if the conditions are not met. The main criterian is that the dollar value of borrow must be lower than the collateral value, adjusted with the collateral ratio. The dollar values of the collateral is calculated in the function `_maxMintAmountBorrow`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDView.sol#L159-L177

This function loops over collateral tokens and calculates how much they are worth. If there are too many tokens, then instead of valuing all the tokens, only the max amount of JUSD that can be minted against that collateral is used. This is done in the function `_getMintAmountBorrow`.

```solidity
if (depositAmount >= reserve.maxColBorrowPerAccount) {
    depositAmount = reserve.maxColBorrowPerAccount;
}
```

Another way the deposit amounts can change, is with withdrawals. During withdrawals, the contract has a similar check function in place, `_isAccountSafe`.
This function is similar to the last checks, with one main difference. When valuing the collaterals, it doesnt check the max limit.

Thus, users can withdraw out tokens and force the contract to hold collateral ratios it didnt intend to. The attack can be carried out via the following steps:

1. JUSDBank allows the minting of 100 JUSD against collateral A, and unlimited tokens against collateral B. Say A, B, JUSD are all similarly priced, so 1 token A can borrow 1 token JUSD.
2. Alice deposits 1000 A tokens. Due to the cap, Alice can only mint 100 JUSD tokens, and not the full 1000.
3. Alice then deposits 900 B tokens, and mints 900 JUSD tokens against it. This is allowed since the cap on B is unlimited, and the account has enough collateral.
4. Alice then withdraws the 900 B tokens. In the account safety checks, the contract does not care for caps as shown. Thus the contract is satisfied with the 1000 A tokens which back the 1000 JUSD borrows.
5. The contract is left in a state where someone has borrowed 1000JUSD against A tokens, which is 10x the cap amount.

Since users can change the risk profile of the contract, this is a critical vulnerability.

## Impact

Contract can be made to ignore colalteral based caps.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Bring both functions `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` and `_isAccountSafe` in sync. Both should check the max mint amount.
