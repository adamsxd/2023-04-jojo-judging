# Bad debts should not accumulate interest

## Summary

`JUSDBank.handleDebt()` handles bad debts by transfering to the `insurance` account. However, this means that the bad debts continue to accumulate interest. 

That is incorrect as the interest (in JUSD) on these bad debts will not be repaid anymore. So the  accumulation of interest will continue to increase the portion of JUSD that is not backed by any collateral.


## Vulnerability Detail
The actual value of JUSD debt is determined by `t0BorrowBalance * getTRate()`, which includes the interest accumulated.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDView.sol#L83-L85
```Solidity
    function getBorrowBalance(address from) external view returns (uint256) {
        return (userInfo[from].t0BorrowBalance * getTRate()) / 1e18;
    }
```

So when `JUSDBank.handleDebt()` transfers the JUSD bad debts to `insurance` account, these JUSD are still accumulating interests.

```Solidity
    function _handleBadDebt(address liquidatedTrader) internal {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage liquidatedTraderInfo = userInfo[
            liquidatedTrader
        ];
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        if (
            liquidatedTraderInfo.collateralList.length == 0 &&
            _isStartLiquidation(liquidatedTraderInfo, tRate)
        ) {
            DataTypes.UserInfo storage insuranceInfo = userInfo[insurance];
            uint256 borrowJUSDT0 = liquidatedTraderInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
            insuranceInfo.t0BorrowBalance += borrowJUSDT0;
            liquidatedTraderInfo.t0BorrowBalance = 0;
            emit HandleBadDebt(liquidatedTrader, borrowJUSDT0);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

To maintain its stability, JUSD must always be backed by more than 1 USD worth of collateral. 

During market volatility, the proportion of bad debts will grow due to liquidation of undercollateralized positions. The accumulation of interest on such bad debts will worsen the situation and affect JUSD stability, possibly leading to a depeg event.

## Recommendation
Instead of transferring to the insurance account, consider creating a stability reserve using JUSDBank interest revenue. During handling of bad debts, the stability reserve can be used to repay and burn the JUSD, so that interests will not accumulate on these bad debts.
