# Approval Race Condition

## Summary
The approval race condition occurs when two or more transactions are submitted in a short period, and they both involve approving and spending the same tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose the contract has another function, `swapStableCoin()`, which also interacts with the same stable coin asset. The function `swapStableCoin()` relies on the previously approved amount of the asset to perform the swap operation.

1. Alice calls the depositStableCoin() function, and the contract resets the approval for the approveTarget contract to spend Alice's asset tokens by calling IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, 0);.
2. Before the depositStableCoin() function can set a new approval for the approveTarget contract to spend the specified amount of Alice's asset tokens, Bob calls the swapStableCoin() function.
3. The swapStableCoin() function relies on the previously approved amount of the asset to perform the swap operation. Since the approval was reset to 0 by Alice's transaction, Bob's transaction will fail due to insufficient approval.
4. Finally, Alice's depositStableCoin() function sets a new approval for the approveTarget contract to spend the specified amount of Alice's asset tokens by calling IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);.

In this scenario, the approval race condition is evident. Alice's transaction reset the approval in the depositStableCoin() function, causing Bob's transaction to fail in the swapStableCoin() function, which relied on the previously approved amount. This issue leads to an undesirable user experience and potential confusion for both Alice and Bob.

## Impact
This issue leads to an undesirable user experience and potential confusion for both users.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the approval reset line `(IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, 0);`, and only set the new approval amount.
