# If the USDC depegs,the calculated tokenPrice value will not be accurate

## Summary
The `getAssetPrice()` function calculates the price of the asset by dividing the Chainlink aggregator price by the USDC price, correcting for decimals and JOJO tokens. When USDC depegs, the calculated tokenPrice value will be affected which could potentially lead to incorrect asset valuations and financial losses for users

## Vulnerability Detail
The `JOJOOracleAdaptor.getAssetPrice()` function is used to query the price of an asset using the Chainlink oracle aggregator and the USDC source, by dividing the Chainlink aggregator price by the USDC price and correcting for decimals and JOJO tokens.
When the USDC price deviates significantly from its actual value, there is a vulnerability in this function. This is because the calculation of the tokenPrice value in this function is based on the ratio between the Chainlink rate contract and the USDC rate contract. If the price of the USDC rate contract deviates significantly from its actual value, the calculated tokenPrice value will be affected and may not be accurate. This vulnerability could potentially lead to incorrect asset valuations and financial losses for users who rely on the getAssetPrice function to obtain accurate asset prices. Therefore, users should be cautious when using this function and ensure that the USDC rate contract price is accurate before relying on the tokenPrice value returned by this function.

```solidity
  function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```
