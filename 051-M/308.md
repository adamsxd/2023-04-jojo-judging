# `JOJODealer` assumes that JUSD is equal to USDC

## Summary
`JOJODealer` assumes JUSD stays equal to USDC which might not be true. This can cause issues with collateralization of trading positions. 

## Vulnerability Detail

From [docs](https://docs.jojo.exchange/JUSD#what-is-jusd):
> JUSD is a stable coin developed by JOJO system to support multi-collateralization. This features allows users to use other non-stable coin assets (BTC, ETH, etc.) as margin for trading. JUSD works like DAI and users can mint JUSD by staking other ERC20 tokens as collateral. JUSD can be freely traded, however, **its price is not guaranteed to be equal to Primary asset in the open market.**

Now in the code, JUSD is assumed to have a price equal to USDC (primary asset), `_isSafe` as an example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L100-L102
```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol

100:            netPositionValue +
101:                state.primaryCredit[trader] +
102:                SafeCast.toInt256(state.secondaryCredit[trader]) >=
```

If the price of JUSD moves below USDC this can cause issues where traders can open positions that aren't sufficiently covered.

Since you win primary credit:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Position.sol#L27
```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Position.sol

27:        state.primaryCredit[trader] += pnl;
```
This can be used to trade the now less valuable JUSD for USDC.

## Impact
If the price of JUSD changes, mainly if it falls below USDC, it could cause problems with how positions are collateralized. Since a trader could open a position against less valuable JUSD and close it, winning USDC.

There are some issues describing how a depeg of JUSD might happen:
- [unborrowed JUSD are stuck in `JUSDBank`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-0ximmeas/issues/2)
- [potential economic issues with JUSD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-0ximmeas/issues/4)
- [`JUSDBank::handleBadDept` can be dangerous](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-0ximmeas/issues/9)
- [`JOJOBank::handleBadDept` can be front run with dust to keep debt bad](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo-0ximmeas/issues/10)

## Recommendation
Either you need to track the price of JUSD/USDC. Or a way to freeze JUSD as collateral, that might make a lot of positions under water though.
