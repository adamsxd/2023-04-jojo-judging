# `uniswapPriceAdaptor` may check quotes on low liquidity pairs as not all tokens are directly liquid

## Summary

Most tokens are liquid against a limited range of other tokens.
The UniV3 Twap reading is performed on a single pair.
Most tokens will offer a valid price vs only one token, but will offer a highly discounted and / or manipulatable price vs most others.



## Vulnerability Detail
For example ARB - USDC

Even USDC - WETH at 1MLN Dollars needs to have it's liquidity fragmented due to price impact

## Impact

`uniswapPriceAdaptor` will leak value as the quote is still somewhat manipulatable and most importantly will be incorrect

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add multiple paths for quotes as a way to ensure that the best quote is found instead of a direct swap
