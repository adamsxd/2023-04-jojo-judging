# attacker could get all USDC amount and drain the protocol funds

## Summary

an attacker can get all USDC in the the system by adding malicious address when calling JUSDbank.flashloan function and passing an address to to that have zero-balance of borrowing, this way the user can get all USDC balance. more details in Vulnerability Detail.

## Vulnerability Detail

the function `flashLoan` in JUSDbank is implemented like this :

```solidity
function flashLoan(
        address receiver,
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes memory param
    ) external nonFlashLoanReentrant {
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];

        _withdraw(amount, collateral, receiver, msg.sender, false);
        // repay
        IFlashLoanReceive(receiver).JOJOFlashLoan(

            collateral,
            amount,
            to,
            param
        );
        require(
            _isAccountSafe(user, getTRate()),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_FLASHLOAN_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
        emit FlashLoan(collateral, amount);
    }
```

if you see the `Flashloan` function you will recognize that the `to` parameter is only used when `IFlashLoanReceive(receiver).JOJOFlashLoan` is called :

```solidity
 function JOJOFlashLoan(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes calldata param
    ) external {
        (address approveTarget, address swapTarget, uint256 minReceive, bytes memory data) = abi
            .decode(param, (address, address, uint256, bytes));
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
        if (success == false) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }
        uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(USDCAmount >= minReceive, "receive amount is too small");
        uint256 JUSDAmount = USDCAmount;

        uint256 borrowBalance = IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getBorrowBalance(to);
        if (USDCAmount <= borrowBalance) {
            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, USDCAmount);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(USDCAmount, address(this));
        } else {

            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, borrowBalance);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(borrowBalance, address(this));
            IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);
            JUSDAmount = borrowBalance;
        }
```

as you can see there is no check if `to` address are even available address or an address that have balance, this can be used by attacker to drain the protocol in scenario below :

1- Alice(an attacker) is calling the `flashloan` function and set the `to` address to an address that `uint256 borrowBalance = 0` this can happen because there is no check to prevent adding a zero-borrow_balance to the `flashloan` function.

2-and after Alice calling the `flashloan` function, this function will make a call to the `JOJOFlashLoan` function in `FlashLoanRepay` to repay the balance as the comment say ` // repay`,

the `JOJOFlashLoan` code(only the part that cause this vulnerability):

```solidity
...
uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
        require(USDCAmount >= minReceive, "receive amount is too small");

 uint256 borrowBalance = IJUSDBank(jusdBank).getBorrowBalance(to);
        if (USDCAmount <= borrowBalance) {
            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, USDCAmount);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(USDCAmount, address(this));
        } else {

            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, borrowBalance);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(borrowBalance, address(this));
            IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);
            JUSDAmount = borrowBalance;

            ...

```

3- as you can see the `borrowBalance` will get the `to` address borrowing balance which in our case `to` address `borrowBalance` is equal to zero.

4-then the function check if(USDCAmount <= borrowBalance) but the attacker will pass this check because borrowBalance is 0 and this mean USDCAmount which is the contract balance is more than zero, and then the code will run the situation when the `USDCAmount` is more than `borrowBalance` :

```solidity

else {

            IERC20(USDC).approve(jusdExchange, borrowBalance);
            IJUSDExchange(jusdExchange).buyJUSD(borrowBalance, address(this));
            IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);
            JUSDAmount = borrowBalance;

```

and all the USDCAmount in the contract will be send to the `to` address because `USDCAmount(for example 100,000) - borrowBalance(to balance is zero 0)` will equal to `USDCAmount` and all USDC will transfer to the `to` address:
`IERC20(USDC).safeTransfer(to, USDCAmount - borrowBalance);`

and then the attacker can handle all the token in the `to` address and drain the protocol(remember that the attacker can set receive and to address to different addresses).

## Impact

an attacker can get all USDC amount in the contract and drain the protocol by adding zero-borrowBalanceAddress to the flashloan.

## Tool used

manual review

## Recommendation

i recomment to check the `to` borrow balance to make sure the address have some amount that borrowed or use only the `receive` address that used to send some flashloan to it instead of using `to` parameter for repay flashloan only.
