# User cannot withdraw his fund on time

## Summary

User cannot withdraw his fund on time

## Vulnerability Detail

We have JOJODealer.sol contract

```solidity
contract JOJODealer is JOJOExternal, JOJOOperation, JOJOView {
    constructor(address _primaryAsset) JOJOStorage() {
        state.primaryAsset = _primaryAsset;
    }

    function version() external pure returns (string memory) {
        return "JOJODealer V1.0";
    }
}
```

all external call is handled by JOJOExternal

when user deposit, the user credit is implemented

```solidity
function deposit(
	uint256 primaryAmount,
	uint256 secondaryAmount,
	address to
) external nonReentrant {
	Funding.deposit(state, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount, to);
}
```

calling

```solidity
  function deposit(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount,
        address to
    ) external {
        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                primaryAmount
            );
            state.primaryCredit[to] += SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
        }
        if (secondaryAmount > 0) {
            IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                secondaryAmount
            );
            state.secondaryCredit[to] += secondaryAmount;
        }
        emit Deposit(to, msg.sender, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
    }
```

when user withdraw, first user needs to call requestWithdraw

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(uint256 primaryAmount, uint256 secondaryAmount)
	external
	nonReentrant
{
	Funding.requestWithdraw(state, primaryAmount, secondaryAmount);
}
```

calling

```solidity
  function requestWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount
    ) external {
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = primaryAmount;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = secondaryAmount;
        state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock;
        emit RequestWithdraw(
            msg.sender,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender]
        );
    }
```

then when withdraw is executed, 

```solidity

    function executeWithdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external {
        require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
        uint256 primaryAmount = state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        uint256 secondaryAmount = state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender];
        state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw[msg.sender] = 0;
        // No need to change withdrawExecutionTimestamp, because we set pending
        // withdraw amount to 0.
        _withdraw(
            state,
            msg.sender,
            to,
            primaryAmount,
            secondaryAmount,
            isInternal
        );
    }
```

and we are calling _withdraw

```solidity
    function _withdraw(
        Types.State storage state,
        address payer,
        address to,
        uint256 primaryAmount,
        uint256 secondaryAmount,
        bool isInternal
    ) private {
        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            state.primaryCredit[payer] -= SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
            if (isInternal) {
                state.primaryCredit[to] += SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
            } else {
                IERC20(state.primaryAsset).safeTransfer(to, primaryAmount);
            }
        }
        if (secondaryAmount > 0) {
            state.secondaryCredit[payer] -= secondaryAmount;
            if (isInternal) {
                state.secondaryCredit[to] += secondaryAmount;
            } else {
                IERC20(state.secondaryAsset).safeTransfer(to, secondaryAmount);
            }
        }

        if (primaryAmount > 0) {
            // if trader withdraw primary asset, we should check if solid safe
            require(
                Liquidation._isSolidSafe(state, payer),
                Errors.ACCOUNT_NOT_SAFE
            );
        } else {
            // if trader didn't withdraw primary asset, normal safe check is enough
            require(Liquidation._isSafe(state, payer), Errors.ACCOUNT_NOT_SAFE);
        }

```

the code deduct and remove the payer's primary credit and secondary credit

this has issues

for example,

user has primary credit 100 token, user has secondary credit 100 token

user request withdraw and wants to withdraw 100 primary token and 100 secondary token

ok tough luck,

user get liquidated and he only has 90 primary token and 100 secondary token in his credit

no one can call execute withdraw because 90 primary token (user credit) - 100 requested withdraw amount revert in arithmic underflow

```solidity
  state.primaryCredit[payer] -= SafeCast.toInt256(primaryAmount);
```

In this case, the 100 secondary token requested amount is also locked

to withdraw fund user has to request withdraw again and subject to timelock wait again

then suppose liquidation happens again, the user does not have sufficient credit and he has to request for withdrawal and subject to timelock wait again...

## Impact

User cannot withdraw his fund on time, user may need to wait for timelock again and again when he request withdraw if the available credit is less than the requested amount
