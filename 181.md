# Stealing funds from users

## Summary
The protocol does not verify swapTarget, and a bad actor can set swapTarget to a token address and data to transferFrom, allowing the protocol to transfer assets to the bad actor's address from any user who has approved the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `GeneralRepay.repayJUSD()` function allows user to repay JUSD debt using the caller's assets, with the option to swap assets if necessary to obtain sufficient USDC to repay the debt.The function first transfers the amount of asset from the caller's address to the contract address. If the asset is not USDC, the function decodes the param parameter to retrieve approveTarget, swapTarget, minAmount, and data, approves the approveTarget to spend the transferred asset, and calls the swapTarget with the provided data.
However, the protocol does not verify swapTarget and data. Therefore, swapTarget.call(data) can execute arbitrary code. A bad actor can set swapTarget to a token address and data to transferFrom, allowing the protocol to transfer assets to the bad actor's address from any user who has approved the protocol.
```solidity
function repayJUSD(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bytes memory param
    ) external {
        IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        uint256 minReceive;
        if (asset != USDC) {
            (address approveTarget, address swapTarget, uint256 minAmount, bytes memory data) = abi
                .decode(param, (address, address, uint256, bytes));
            IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
            if (success == false) {
                assembly {
                    let ptr := mload(0x40)
                    let size := returndatasize()
                    returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                    revert(ptr, size)
                }
            }
            minReceive = minAmount;
        }

```
