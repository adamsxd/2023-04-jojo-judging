# deploying of `EmergencyOracle.sol` can front-running by an attacker

## Summary

an attacker can frontrun the deployement of the EmergencyOracle when owner want to deploy EmergencyOracle for the first time, and this give the attacker full control on the price and other functions that using oracles price.

## Vulnerability Detail

an attacker can front-running the owner when the owner want to deploy EmergencyOracle for the first time, i will explain the steps that the attacker can take over the EmergencyOracle :

1-first the owner want to deploy the `EmergencyOracle` becuase the other oracle faild for some reasons, the owner start deploying the EmergencyOracle contract to set the emergency oracle so users can use it

2-the attacker recognize that the owner want to deploy the contract of EmergencyOracle to set it as the oracle for other users, the attacker front running the owner transaction of the deploying the EmergencyOracle by calling `EmergencyOracleFactory.newEmergencyOracle` funtion.

3- the `newEmergencyOracle` will create a new EmergencyOracle and set it as the oracle for all other functions that use oracles to get the prices and cause to many bad scenario that maight happen

this scenario will happen when the `EmergencyOracleFactory.sol` deployed first and before the `EmergencyOracle.sol` and it may be happen even without needing to call the `newEmergencyOracle` by frontrun the owner Transaction, so i set it as medium risk.

## Impact

deploying of EmergencyOracle may frontrun and cause other users loose found when interacting with function that use oracles

## Tool used

Manual Review / remix

## Recommendation

preventing frontrun attack is hard but i recommend the owner/team to deploy the `EmergencyOracleFactory.sol` first and set the `newEmergencyOracle` as `onlyOwner` so only owner can call it, or add a timelock for the `EmergencyOracleFactory.sol` that should not be callable when the EmergencyOracle deploying by the owner
