# A user can bypass request withdraw by just calling executewithdraw

## Summary

According to the docs, withdrawing funds should a be a 2 step process, by calling requestwithdraw and then calling withdraw. However, the function requestwithdraw can be bypassed since it checks whether  
state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp. However this is 0 by default so a user can bypass the first step and withdraw funds, undermining the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

see above 

## Impact

Protocol will not function properly

## Recommendation

Add a requirement that requestwithdraw is called before executewithdraw.
