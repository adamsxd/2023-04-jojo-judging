# A liquidated trader's new credit balance is calculated incorrectly during liquidation

## Summary

A liquidated trader's new credit balance is calculated incorrectly during liquidation because it is derived from the liquidator's credit balance change which has been discounted.

## Vulnerability Detail

`liqedCreditChange`, or the liquidated trader's credit balance change, is calculated as part of liquidating a trader whose position is unhealthy. However, this value is [derived](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L366) from the `liqtorCreditChange`, or liquidator's credit balance change. Deriving the credit change of the liquidated trader directly from the liquidator's credit change is incorrect because `liqtorCreditChange` is [calculated](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L311-L320) at a _discounted price_ as an incentive for the liquidator. The liquidator is taking on the position of the liquidated trader at a discounted price, but the credit removed from the liquidated trader should be calculated at the full price of the perpetual.

## Impact

By deriving `liqedCreditChange` from the discounted `liqtorCreditChange`, the amount of credit being removed from the liquidated trader is less than it should be. This could incorrectly cause bad debt to accumulate in the protocol, even though liquidators have removed the bad debt.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L311-L320

```solidity
    uint256 price = IMarkPriceSource(params.markPriceSource).getMarkPrice();
    uint256 priceOffset = (price * params.liquidationPriceOff) / Types.ONE;
    price = liqtorPaperChange > 0
        ? price - priceOffset
        : price + priceOffset;
    // calculate credit change
    liqtorCreditChange =
        -1 *
        liqtorPaperChange.decimalMul(SafeCast.toInt256(price));
```

```solidity
liqedCreditChange = liqtorCreditChange * -1 - SafeCast.toInt256(insuranceFee);
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

Consider calculating the `liqedCreditChange` in the [`getLiquidateCreditAmount` function](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L279) with the non-discounted price of the perpetual. With the correct credit amount being removed from the liquidated address, JOJO should note that the liquidated address may be unable to pay for the `insuranceFee`.
