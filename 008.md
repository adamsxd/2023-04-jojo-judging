# Anyone can on behalf of others to borrow money

## Summary
The borrow() function allows users to borrow an amount (tAmount) of JUSD tokens. The function appears that the borrower can specify the recipient of the borrowed funds by providing the 'to' address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `borrow()` doesn't seem to have checking to prevent a user from borrowing funds on behalf of another user or even an attacker borrowing funds and sending them to another user. 

However, the borrow action is recorded in the t0BorrowBalance of the borrower's UserInfo struct (user), so the borrower is still responsible for repaying the borrowed amount, regardless of the recipient.

## Impact
If an attacker helps a user to borrow a large sum of money, even if the attacker fails to obtain the money, the user still needs to repay the loan.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement access control, the `address to` value of the function should be sender.
