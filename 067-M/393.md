# M-2 : Liquidator could fail to liquidate USDC Blacklisted

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
It can happen that an account is liquidated even when its debts are collateralized by >= 100%. This is due to the liquidation mortgage rate. In such cases, the collateral of the liquidated user is more than sufficient to pay off the debt. Therefore, the liquidator, taking the debt and collateral, has to repay the remaining amount in USDC to the liquidated user. However, if the user is blacklisted by the USDC protocol, the attempt to transfer USDC will fail, and the whole liquidation transaction will be unsuccessful.




## Impact
Trying to liquidate a USDC BlackListed can result in a failed transaction.

//

    require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated) - 
                primaryLiquidatedAmount >=
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To avoid the liquidator experiencing a failed transaction, one option is to update the balances internally and delegate the responsibility of withdrawing to the liquidated user.
