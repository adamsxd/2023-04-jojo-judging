# It doesn't check the length of orderList, signatureList and matchPaperAmount.

## Summary

It doesn't check the length of orderList, signatureList, and matchPaperAmount.

## Vulnerability Detail

`approveTrade()` parses tradeData, extracts orderList, signatureList and matchPaperAmount. But it doesn't check that these lengths should be equal.

## Impact

The length of orderList, signatureList and matchPaperAmount may not be equal, some orders may be lost.
