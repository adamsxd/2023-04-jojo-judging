# Some functions don't let the user approve before the safeTransferFrom method is used

## Summary
The _repay() function doesn't let the user approve before the safeTransferFrom method is used.
## Vulnerability Detail
Both `SafeTransferFrom` and `transferFrom` functions in the ERC-20 standard require the sender to have an allowance for the ERC-20 tokens they are attempting to transfer.

The `safeTransferFrom` and `transferFrom` functions moves amount tokens from sender to recipient using the allowance mechanism. amount is then deducted from the callerâ€™s allowance.

## Impact
Without an allowance, the transfer will fail, and the transaction would be reverted.
