# `Operation.setInsurance` should also move the credit.

## Summary

`Operation.setInsurance` is used to change the address of the insurance. But it doesn’t move the credit. If the owner needs to use it to change the insurance address in an emergency(like the old address is in danger), the credit could be stuck in the old address.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Operation.setInsurance` only changes the address. It doesn’t move the credit.

```solidity
    function setInsurance(Types.State storage state, address newInsurance)
        external
    {
        address oldInsurance = state.insurance;
        state.insurance = newInsurance;
        emit SetInsurance(oldInsurance, newInsurance);
    }
```

## Impact

The credit could be stuck in the old address.
