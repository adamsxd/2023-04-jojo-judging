# Precision loss leads to stolen funds

## Summary
Big precision loss due to bad rounding (rounding before multiplication), allows an attacker to steal many tokens for cheap.

## Vulnerability Detail

I will now explain the vulnerability in depth. I will show an example and PoC of the vulnerability using the `JUSDBank` and the `UniswapPriceAdaptor`, but it's important to note that **this vulnerability affects all oracle adaptors (UniswapPriceAdaptor and JOJOOracleAdaptor)  and both JUSDBank and smart-contract-EVM.**

### The vulnerability
The exchange rate between two tokens is some "ideal" ratio

$$\texttt{price} = \frac{\text{price}_\texttt{nominator}}{\text{price}_\texttt{denominator}}$$

And the price of `amount` should be calculated like so to avoid rounding errors:

$$
\texttt{real price}(\text{amount}) = \frac{\texttt{amount} \cdot \texttt{price}_\texttt{nominator}}{\texttt{price}_\texttt{denominator}}
$$

To see this in action go to [StaticOracle on etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB210CE856631EeEB767eFa666EC7C1C57738d438#readContract). You can call the `quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod` with `amount` that has many zeros, you can see that no matter how many zeros you add, the price is still not exact (i.e. even with a lot of zeros, the lowest digits are still non-zero, these are the digits that get rounded).

But  when using the uniswap price adaptor (this also applies to the JOJO oracle adaptor), the function [quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/main/src/oracle/UniswapPriceAdaptor.sol#L49)  is used to get the price of `ONE` (i.e. $10^\texttt{decimals}$) tokens, then to get the price of a different amount you need to multiply by `amount` and divide by $10^\texttt{decimals}$, like so

$$\texttt{jojo price}(\text{amount}) = \frac{\texttt{real price}\left(10^{\texttt{decimals}}\right) \cdot \texttt{amount}}{10^\texttt{decimals}} = 
\frac{\frac{10^{\texttt{decimals}}\cdot \texttt{price}_\texttt{nominator}}{\texttt{price}_\texttt{denominator}} \cdot \texttt{amount}}{10^\texttt{decimals}}$$

But there's rounding in the division in the nominator! The loss due to rounding is around $1$ and then it is multiplied by `amount` and divided by $10^\texttt{decimals}$, hence the total loss is

$$
\texttt{loss} =
\frac{
\overbrace{\left(\frac{10^{\texttt{decimals}}\cdot \texttt{price}_\texttt{nominator}}{\texttt{price}_\texttt{denominator}}\right)}^{\text{rounding loss}\ \approx\  1} \cdot \texttt{amount}}{10^\texttt{decimals}}
$$

Hence the total loss is
$$\boxed{\texttt{loss} \approx \frac{\texttt{amount}}{10^{\texttt{decimals}}}}$$

The loss in a single transaction is proportional to the amount! Thus for large enough amounts, the loss could be big! Let's look at USDC as an example (which is the actual token used currently by the protocol).

This vulnerability affects a lot of the code. The easiest way to exploit it to steal tokens is by:
1. Deposit a lot of collateral
2. Liquidate the account and repurchase the collateral at a lower price due to the precision loss

### Numeric example - USDC
For USDC, `decimals=6`, and it is reasonable to flash loan in the tens of millions of dollars (i.e. around $10^7\sim 10^8$), hence the loss is
$$\texttt{USDC loss} \approx \frac{10^7}{10^{6}} \approx 10\$ \sim 100 \$ $$
**It is possible to have a price difference of tens of dollars in a single transaction!**

Now an attacker can run the exploit in a loop, and earn as much as he wants. The gained amount can be more than the gas paid.

### Different coins

Note that different coins have different precision losses, in general, the loss can be calculated by

$$\texttt{token loss} \approx \frac{\texttt{reasonable flash loan amount}}{10^{\texttt{token decimals}}}$$

I used https://cryptoslate.com/blockchain/ethereum/ and calculated a reasonable loss an attacker could achieve for different coins. Note that I only included some examples of coins I recognized that had a good ratio. Also, all the different USD coins (USDC, USDT, DAI, etc...) have the same loss as calculated above.

- Shiba Inu (SHIB) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 1,000,000\$$
- Reserve (RSR) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 3,000\$$
- Ankr (ANKR) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 1,000\$$
- Cronos (CRO) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 500\$$
- Chiliz (CHZ) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 300\$$
- The Graph (GRT) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 100\$$
- Keep Network (KEEP) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 100\$$
- SwissBorg (CHSB) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 100\$$
- Fantom (FTM) --> $\texttt{precision loss} \approx 20\$$

### Why is this different than buying a small amount many times?

You could argue that we could've done the same thing by buying a small amount each time, and when we buy a small amount there's the exact same rounding, then you can just repeat many times.

The big difference is **GAS** and time. Because of the vulnerability, a single transaction is enough to steal a considerable amount of money, more money than the transaction gas fee cost. But if you buy many small amounts you need to repeat many many times until any considerable amount is taken, so many times it's not possible, the gas fees alone would cost around $\times 10^{\texttt{decimals}}$ times more than the amount earned (i.e. you need to pay at millions to get a single dollar).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The interface `getMarkPrice()` and `getAssetPrice()` are inherently problematic, since they return the price of $10^{\texttt{decimals}}$ tokens, rounded. The oracle adaptor functions should get `uint256 amount` as an input, and return the price of `amount` (instead of the price of `ONE`).

The function signature should be

```solidity
function getAssetPrice(uint256 amount) external view returns (uint256);
```
instead of
```solidity
function getAssetPrice() external view returns (uint256);
```
And for example, in the `UniswapPriceAdaptor`, you should replace the call to the oracle with
```solidity
// Pass `amount` to the function, instead of (10**decimals)
(uint256 uniswapPriceFeed,) = IStaticOracle(UNISWAP_V3_ORACLE).quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod(amount, baseToken, quoteToken, period);
```
And finally, the codes using the `getAssetPrice` function should also be modified:

**Bad:**
```solidity
uint256 price = reserve.oracle.getAssetPrice();
uint256 amountToPay = amount.decimalMul(price);
```

**Good:**
```solidity
// Pass `amount` to the `getAssetPrice` function
uint256 amountToPay = reserve.oracle.getAssetPrice(amount);
```
