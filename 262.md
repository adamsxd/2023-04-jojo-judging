# insuranceFee, makerFee and takerFee should not be zero

## Summary
insuranceFee, makerFee and takerFee should not be zero

## Vulnerability Detail

For insurance fee, see the following code snippet in JUSDBank#_calculateLiquidateAmount

```solidity
liquidateData.insuranceFee = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(
      reserve.insuranceFeeRate
);
```

```solidity
liquidateData.insuranceFee = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalMul(reserve.insuranceFeeRate)
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
```                

For maker fee, see the following code in Trading#_matchOrders,

```solidity
     int256 fee = SafeCast.toInt256(creditChange.abs()).decimalMul(
                    _info2MakerFeeRate(orderList[i].info)
                );
```

For taker fee, see the following code in Trading#_matchOrders,
                
```solidity
int256 takerFee = SafeCast.toInt256(result.creditChangeList[0].abs())
                .decimalMul(_info2TakerFeeRate(orderList[0].info));```
```
                
## Impact

For insurance fee,

During liquidation, insurance fee could be zero when amount / JUSDBorrowed value is too 
small.

For maker fee,

During making order, makerFee could be zero when creditChange.abs()) is too small or info2MakerFeeRate is too big

For taker fee,

During taking order, takerFee could be zero when result.creditChangeList[0].abs() is too small or _info2TakerFeeRate(orderList[0].info) is too big

If there is no fee charges, protocol will not earn anything from liquidation and trading activities.
