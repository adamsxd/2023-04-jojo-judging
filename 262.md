# Arbitrum Sequencer Down Check Missing in chainlinkAdaptor#getMarkPrice

## Summary

The lack of checks to determine if the Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down. to ensure that the sequencer is live before trusting the data returned by the oracle. This check is not implemented in chainlinkAdaptor#getMarkPrice

## Vulnerability Detail

If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, the oracle data will not be kept up-to-date and could become stale. However, users can still continue to interact with the protocol directly. You can review Chainlink's documentation on [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds/) for more details on this.

As a result, users may be able to use the protocol while oracle feeds are stale. This could cause many problems, but as a simple example:

- Alice has an open long position with some leverage.
- The Arbitrum sequencer goes down temporarily.
- While it's down, the price of the token falls to a point where Alice's position does not have enough margin to save it from liquidation.
- Because of the stale price, the protocol does not allow Alice's position to be liquidated, and
- Alice takes advantage of this situation and closes the position without being liquidated.

chainlinkAdaptor#getMarkPrice does not check whether the Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down. As a result, the prices provided might be falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down.

```solidity
function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
    int256 rawPrice;
    uint256 updatedAt;
    (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
    (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
    require(
        block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
        "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
    );
    require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
    uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
    return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
}
```

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is potentially severe, as users could falsely liquidated or book incorrect profit/loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a check to determine whether the sequencer is down.
It is recommended to follow the code example provided by Chainlinkand re-write getMarkPrice:
