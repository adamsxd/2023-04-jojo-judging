# Chainlink's latestRoundData Might Return Stale Results at smart-contract-EVM/contracts/adaptor/chainlinkAdaptor.sol

## Summary
latestRoundData() is used when trying to get currentPrice, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

This is the duty of your project to check that returned price is fresh and not stale and then use it on the project! because you are using the price for user liquidation, so you have to increase safety about price.

## Vulnerability Detail
Across these contracts, you are using Chainlink's latestRoundData API, but there is only a check on updatedAt. This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation.
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data

```solidity
    function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPriceproject must;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

## Impact
The result of the latestRoundData API will be used across various functions, therefore, a stale price from Chainlink can lead to a loss of funds to end-users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the missing checks for stale data.

For example:
```solidity

(uint80 roundID ,answer,, uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = AggregatorV3Interface(chainLinkAggregatorMap[underlying]).latestRoundData();

require(answer > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0"); 
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
require(timestamp != 0, "Round not complete");
```
