# Oracle Adapter allows outdated oracle values

## Summary
The OracleAdapter only allows you to define a single heartbeat interval although it queries two different oracles, asset/USD & USDC/USD. These two feeds don't necessarily have the same heartbeat interval meaning one of them will be allowed to be outdated.

## Vulnerability Detail
You can only define a single heartbeat interval for two oracles:
```sol
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
```

In the case of the JUSD contracts, there will be an oracle for ETH/USDC and BTC/USDC. For ETH/USDC you need to use the [ETH/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd) with a heartbeat every hour and [USDC/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd) with a heartbeat every hour, see [feed docs](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=ethereum). Meaning, the ETH/USD oracle is allowed to be stale for up to a day. The same thing applies to BTC/USDC as well.

Because there can only be one heartbeat interval value and that value is immutable you have to go with the bigger number. Otherwise, the adapter would revert.

## Impact
JUSDBank can work with outdated price data for ETH/USD and BTC/USD.

## Recommendation
Set a different heartbeat value for each feed.
