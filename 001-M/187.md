# Important check is commented out

## Summary

JOJOOracleAdaptor has the `uint80 roundID` commented out meaning devs probably forgot to integrate this inorder to have the check for return of stale or incorrect data from `latestRoundData()`

Though been clearly stated that "potential failures of chainlink" issues are out of scope, I submitted this cause it seems the team forgot to integrate since the `roundID` is commented out and if this is intended then code is disadvantageous to the user if stale prices gets returned and that means not enough protection of users from your end

## Vulnerability Detail

In the getAssetPrice() function of JOJOOracleAdaptor you can see that the `uint80 roundID` is commented out which means that the team probably forgot to uncomment and implement this in order to check if the return value indicates stale data.

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

Now if this is intended behaviour the line could be removed, but team should know that users would be vulnerable to an attack whenever the returned data is stale

## Impact

Improper protection of users due to commenting important check by devs or users being vulnerable to stale data from chainlink

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Uncomment the `uint80 roundID` and implement the stale price return check in oracle
