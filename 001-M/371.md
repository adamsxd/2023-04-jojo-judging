# Unsufficient return values checked from Chainlink

## Summary
Unexpected values could be returned when calling chainlink's `latestRoundData()`
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/adaptor/chainlinkAdaptor.sol#L48-L52
Only `updatedAt` is used to check if it's within the `heartbeatInterval`. 
`rawPrice` is used to calculate `tokenPrice` but is not checked if price returned = 0. 
Furthermore, round completeness is not checked.

This could lead to either positions being liquidated  while they should not be or the other way around.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include the following for round completeness and price checks:
`require(rawPrice > 0, "Oracle error");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Round error");`
