# Rich adversary can grief borrowing of all users at no cost

## Summary
On borrow, protocol has a check that ensures total amount deposited into the protocol, or borrowed does not exceed the GLOBAL max set by the protocol. This check is enforced in `borrow()` and `deposit()`.

A sandwich attack by the adversary can prevent users from borrowing or depositing at practically no cost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The root to this issue is that loans can be borrowed and repayed in the same block. Similarly, collaterals can be deposited and withdrawn in the same block. And if such actions are done in the same block, adversary does not have to pay any interest yet since `block.timestamp` remains the same.The calculated `getTRate()` to determine amount that has to be repaid/withdrawn is the same.

An adversary can sandwich any transaction that is trying to borrow, or deposit by borrowing/deposit a large amount, forcing the protocol to exceed the global limit, and then repaying/withdrawing at the end of the block. This will cause the victim's transcation to revert as it has exceeded the global limit. 


## Impact
1. Borrowing by users can be griefed. This effectively prevents the protocol from working as intended perpetually.
2. A more scheming adversary can force a user's position to be liquidated. They can prevent them from depositing collateral to provide support for their borrows. A user's position who is nearly at risk cannot deposit collateral, and hence be eventually liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Minimally, we can prevent deposit/borrow and withdraw/repay in the same block. We can also consider adding a fee for depositing and borrowing to increase the cost for attacker.
