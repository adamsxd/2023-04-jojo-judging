# `depositStablecoin` will revert for USDT (it's expected to support USDT)

## Summary
When the user wants to deposit USDT, `depositStablecoin` function will end up reverting.

## Vulnerability Detail
- USDT's `approve` doesn't return a boolean, which is expected from the IERC20 interface, so the tx will revert -- trying to decode the no-return value.

## Impact
USDT or any other expected tokens that may have mis-implemented the IERC20 interface (e.g. doesn't have return value), will make the tx revert.
