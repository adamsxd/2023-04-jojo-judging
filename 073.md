# Flash liquidation leads to stolen funds

## Summary

Due to tiny price changes, it is possible to deposit and liquidate the same trader on the same transaction, allowing an attacker to fashion and steal tokens from `JUSDBank` and `JOJODealer`

The same issue affects both `JUSDBank` and `smart-contract-EVM`, even though their code is completely different.

## Vulnerability Detail

I will use `JUSDBank` as an example, but the exact same steps are required to exploit `smart-contract-EVM`.

A user is safe if he has enough collateral against his borrows, as long as a user is safe, he can't be liquidated. Once a user becomes unsafe (if the price of the collateral decreased, or some of his collateral was delisted, etc...) other users can liquidate him, and buy his collateral at a discount.

After each operation that could leave the user unsafe (such as borrowing and withdrawing), there's a check that the user is safe. Hence the user can't make a call to the contract that would leave him unsafe. Let's understand that more in-depth:

The liquidation condition is:

$$\texttt{liquidationMaxMintAmount} < \texttt{JUSDBorrow}$$

Where:

$$\texttt{liquidationMaxMintAmount} = \sum_\texttt{collaterals} \texttt{balance} \cdot \texttt{price} \cdot \texttt{rate} $$

and

$$\texttt{JUSDBorrow} = \texttt{t0BorrowBalance} \cdot \texttt{tRate}$$

Now what if we borrow enough such that the numbers arrange such that after the borrow, the account is very very close to being unsafe (but is still safe), 

$$\texttt{liquidationMaxMintAmount} \approx \texttt{JUSDBorrow} \underbrace{-\ \ 1}_{\text{very small}}$$

Now the account is almost unsafe, and even a very very small change to `price` would cause the account to pass the threshold and become unsafe. Now that it's unsafe we would be able to buy his collateral at a discount, and steal some collateral from the `JUSDBank`.

We'll discuss that more later, but the price is determined by the oracle, and small changes can occur from reasonable actions. Also, it is possible to exploit it by frontrunning instead, which is also discussed later.

Here are PoC steps to exploit this (all in a single transaction):
1. Flash loans a large amount of collateral
2. Deposit all the collateral to `JUSDBank`
3. Borrow from `JUSDBank` until the account is very close to being unsafe
4. Make the asset price slightly smaller\* such that now the account is unsafe.
5. Liquidate the account (from a different user), and buy the same tokens at a discount
6. Profit

The attacker gained because he bought the tokens at a discount.

For the same attack on `smart-contract-EVM`, replace the word `borrow` with the word `trade`.

### The importance of the entire exploit being on the same transaction

The critical issue here is that the attacker can borrow and liquidate at the same transaction. If this was not possible, and multiple transactions were needed, then it is possible for someone else to liquidate the account before the attacker, and the attacker would lose.

### Exploit with price change

The exploit requires that somehow we change the asset price given by the oracle. It's impossible to manipulate the oracle to make the asset price change by a lot, but the trick is that we make sure that after the borrow, the account is very very very close to being unsafe, so the change in the price oracle would also need to be tiny.

To be exact, the change to the asset price needs to be in the order of $10^{-\texttt{decimals}}$ (to go from safe to unsafe, it's enough that only the least significant digit of the price changes), most common tokens have $18$ decimals, so the oracle price should change by around $10^{-18}$, which is a $\sim 0.0000000000000001$% change to the price, which is definitely doable by investing even a small amount to the LP of the token.

### Exploit without price change

It is possible to exploit this vulnerability without doing anything with the price oracle. There are operations that an operator can do that would turn an account from being safe to be unsafe, such as delisting a reserve, changing the funding rate, updating the fee rate, etc...

Whenever an operator does such an operation, an attacker could front-run him and design a block that looks like:

Crafted blockchain block:
1. Transaction 1 --  Deposit into an account, and borrow so it's almost unsafe
2. Transaction 2 --  The transaction of the operator that would turn the account unsafe (delist, update funding rate, update fee rate, etc...)
3. Transaction 3 --  Liquidate the account

The attacker is guaranteed that no one will liquidate before him, because if he won the front run, he completely controls the block, and if he loses the front run, nothing would happen (since he won't publish his malicious transactions to other miners)

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend the following:
1. After each operation that requires a check that the account is safe, add a time lock of at least one block, during this time it should be impossible to liquidate the account. That way it's impossible to borrow and liquidate in the same transaction no matter what.
2. After a borrow/trade, it's possible for an account to be arbitrarily close to being unsafe. I suggest that the safety check after borrow/trade would have harsher safety requirements, such that you need a considerable change for the account to become unsafe.
