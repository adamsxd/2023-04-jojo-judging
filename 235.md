# chainlinkAdaptor#getMarkPrice is not checked for round completeness

## Summary

chainlinkAdaptor#getMarkPrice is not checked for round completeness. No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to Chainlink's documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external Chainlink oracle, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the oracle could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the index price calculations. Oracle reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems, and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion.

```solidity
    null() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
}
```

## Impact

If there is a problem with chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

This could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price.

## Recommendation

Reccomend adding checks for round Completeness.

```solidity
    null() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
+        (roundID, rawPrice, , updatedAt, answeredInRound ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
+        (USDCroundID, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt, USDCAnsweredInRound) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
+     require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
+     require(USDCAnsweredInRound>= USDCroundID, "round not complete");

        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
}
```
