# Large withdrawalExcutionTimestamp value could prevent withdrawal forever

## Summary
Large withdrawalExcutionTimestamp value could prevent withdrawal forever

## Vulnerability Detail
See Funding#executeWithdrawal,

```solidity
  require(
            state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp,
            Errors.WITHDRAW_PENDING
        );
```

withdrawalExecutionTimestamp needs to be <= block.timestamp in order for withdrawal to be performed. However, withdrawalExecutionTimestamp could be a EXTREMELY large value.

For example,     

1. 

In Operation#setWithdrawTimeLock,
A malicious user sets state.withdrawTimeLock to a EXTREMELY large value, let say uint.max - block.timestamp - 1000

2.

Then in the same block, a normal user calls Funding#requestWithdraw,

state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] =
            block.timestamp +
            state.withdrawTimeLock; 

= block.timestamp + (uint.max - block.timestamp - 1000) 
= uint.max - 1000

3. 

Then in the same block again, the normal user calls Funding#executeWithdraw. An EXTREMELY large state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] will always make the following state.withdrawExecutionTimestamp[msg.sender] <= block.timestamp condition will always fail

This is because uint.max - 1000 will never be <= block.timestamp

As per writing, the current timestamp is 1683672538, 100 years from now will be 1683672538 + (365 * 86400 * 100) = 3839365138 which is still less than uint.max - 1000

(I assume this protocol will last for 100 years)

## Impact
Withdrawal will be stuck forever

## Recommendation
Change Operation#setWithdrawTimeLock. Restrict the function to be called by owner only
