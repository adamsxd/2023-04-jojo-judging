# `Trading.sol#_matchOrders` the positive and negative values of fee are also affected by `creditChange`

## Summary

`Trading.sol#_matchOrders` the positive and negative values of fee are also affected by `creditChange`

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: lib/Trading.sol
124                 result.paperChangeList[currentTraderIndex] += paperChange;
125                 result.creditChangeList[currentTraderIndex] += creditChange - fee;
```

If the fee itself is a positive number, it should always decrease the size of the `creditChange` (since the owner of the order pays the orderender this part of the money). But according to the current implementation, if the fee is a positive number and the `creditChange` is a negative number, it will increase the size of the `creditChange`.

The same problem also in `Liquidation.sol#requestLiquidation` function.

## Impact

This results in the user not actually paying the fee

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to adjust the positive or negative of `fee` according to the positive or negative of `creditChange`

```diff
                // store matching result, including fees
                result.paperChangeList[currentTraderIndex] += paperChange;
-               result.creditChangeList[currentTraderIndex] += creditChange - fee;
+               int256 tempFee = creditChange > 0 ? fee : (-1 * fee) 
+               result.creditChangeList[currentTraderIndex] += (creditChange - tempFee);
                result.paperChangeList[0] -= paperChange;
                result.creditChangeList[0] -= creditChange;
                result.orderSenderFee += fee;
```
