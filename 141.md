# Subaccount.execute is not payable, so user can't provide amount along with the call

## Summary
Subaccount.execute does not have payable, so user can't provide amount along with the call.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Subaccount.execute` has `value` param which will be sent along [with the call to the `to` address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol#L47). The problem is that this function doesn't have payable modifier, so it's not possible to provide eth with the call. As result it will be not possible to exacute call with eth value.
## Impact
user can't provide amount along with the call
