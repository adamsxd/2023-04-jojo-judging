# Attacker can frontrun SubaccountFactory.newSubaccount and steal user funds

## Summary
Because `SubaccountFactory.newSubaccount` creates account using `create` function, that means that attacker can frontrun the call in order to get control under that account. And if victim has sent any token or made approvals, then attacker can steal them.
## Vulnerability Detail
`SubaccountFactory.newSubaccount` creates new subaccount for the `msg.sender`. It uses [`create` function to do that](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/subaccount/SubaccountFactory.sol#L40).
Once user has created subaccount then he can create some token approvals for that subaccount to be able to open positions.
It's possible that user will make this 2 tx one by one.
1.He creates subaccount.
2.He approves USDC to the subaccount.

Attacker can watch to such transactions and when he detects them, then he reorders in following way.
1.Attacker creates subaccount(so now he controls that account address as `create` is used).
2.Victim approves USDC to attackers subaccount.

As result, victim has approved subaccount where owner is attacker. So now attacker can use `Subaccount.execute` in order to steal those tokens.
## Impact
Attacker can steal funds.

## Recommendation
Create subaccount using `create2` with salt that contains `msg.sender` info.
