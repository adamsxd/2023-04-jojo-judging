# Liquidator can steal collateral by buying NFTs from a liquidated user

## Summary

A liquidator can steal parts or all of the remaining collateral in a liquidation if the liquidated user has NFTs for sale.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user is liquidated the remaining collateral is sent to the liquidated user. 

This is enforced in `JUSDBank#liquidate()`:
```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated) -
                primaryLiquidatedAmount >=
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
```

`liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` is the value of the remaining collateral after their debt has been completely repaid. This can be seen in `JUSDBank#_calculateLiquidateAmount()`:
```solidity
function _calculateLiquidateAmount(
	...
	...
	...
uint256 liquidateAmount = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(
            JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate
        );
        uint256 JUSDBorrowed = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);

        if (liquidateAmount <= JUSDBorrowed) {
			...
			...
			...
        } else {
insuranceFeeRate)
            liquidateData.actualCollateral = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalDiv(priceOff)
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
            liquidateData.insuranceFee = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalMul(reserve.insuranceFeeRate) 
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate)
            liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
            liquidateData.actualLiquidated = JUSDBorrowed;
        }

        liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC = (amount - //@audit accountfor fee?
            liquidateData.actualCollateral).decimalMul(price);
    }
```

A liquidator could steal parts or even all of the remaining USDC and still pass the require statement above if the user in question has NFTs listed for sale on an exchange. The user will receive USDC from the sale but the liquidator can steal an equal amount (the upper limit is `liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` ) of the remaining USDC and still complete the liquidation.

To perform this attack a liquidator will do the following:

The attacker would look for all users that are close to having unsafe positions and that are selling NFTs on an exchange.

The attacker will deploy a contract that has the same function signature as `IFlashLoanReceive#JOJOFlashLoan`, this contract will be used in the liquidation process and accessed by setting the appropriate `afterOperationParam` in `JUSDBank#liquidate()`. 

The contract will function as the provided `FlashLoanLiquidate` contract with one key difference, it will buy NFTs from the liquidated user and send an equal value of the remaining USDC to themselves instead of the liquidated user. If the NFTs bought are worth more than `liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` the contract will take the entire amount, if they are worth less they will only be able to steal an amount equal to the NFTs value. 

The liquidate user will have sold one or multiple NFts but they will have lost the same value or in the worst case the entire amount of `liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC`

## Impact

Liquidators can steal from users with unsafe positions if they have NFTs listed for sale on an exchange. In the worst case, all of the remaining USDC after liquidation can be stolen.

## Tool used

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation

Remove the dependency on the USDC balance of the liquidated user. Add new functionality to allow liquidators to deposit USDC into the JUSDBank (or another separate contract) and allow liquidators to pull those funds out. The change in the amount deposited this way should govern if enough has been sent to the liquidated user.
