# Protocol assumes USDC/JUSD exchange rate is 1:1, which may lead to loss of funds in case of a depeg

## Summary

The protocol assumes the exchange rate of 1:1 between USDC and JUSD, which can lead to loss of funds in the case of a depeg. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol assumes the exchange rate of 1:1 between USDC and JUSD, which can lead to loss of funds in the case of a depeg. In the event of a price drop of USDC, users may be able to exchange their USDC by JUSD on `JUSDExchange` and withdraw collateral (for example, WBTC) on `JUSDBank` at a discounted price, making the protocol take the loss. This event [has happened](https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-whales-suffer-huge-losses-due-to-usdc-depeg-svb-collapse) in the past, and has caused huge losses to users. 

Affected code: `JUSDBank.sol`, `JUSDExchange.sol`, `Liquidation.sol`

## Impact

User loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use chainlink oracles to calculate the exchange rate of USDC/USD throughout the system and derivate the value of JUSD based on the collateral deposited in the JUSDBank.
