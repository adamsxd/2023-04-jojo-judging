# Subaccount has no payable methods

## Summary
[Subaccount.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol) doesn't implement a  `payable` method nor a `payable` `fallback()` or `receive()` method.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`execute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol#L45-L58) takes as its last formal parameter the amount of ETH it should send within its external `call()`, but given that the contract cannot receive ETH along with this call, or when being initiazlied, or by it being transferred directly to it, any call to `execute()` in which its last parameter is `!= 0` will revert.

There is still a possibility for Subaccount.sol to receive ETH either via being the target of another contract's `selfdestruct()` or by receiving validator rewards, but I consider this to be out of reach for standard users trying to operate their subaccount.

## Impact
Unexpected reverting transactions

## Code Snippet
The following is a foundry PoC test case to verify my finding:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import "../contracts/subaccount/SubaccountFactory.sol";
import "../contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol";

contract SubaccountPoC is Test {
    
    SubaccountFactory factory;
    Subaccount sub;
    address user;
    address identity = address(4);

    function setUp() external {
        user = makeAddr("user");
        vm.deal(user, 1_000 ether);
        factory = new SubaccountFactory();
        
        vm.prank(user);
        sub = Subaccount(factory.newSubaccount());
    }

    function test_SubaccountCantReceiveETH() external {
        vm.startPrank(user);

        // standard transfers fail as no payable fallback/receive function is implemented
        (bool success, ) = payable(address(sub)).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        assertFalse(success);

        // raw calls sending value revert as `execute` in not payable
        vm.expectRevert();
        address(sub).call{value: 1 ether}(abi.encodeWithSelector(sub.execute.selector, identity, hex"deadbeef", 1 ether));

        // calls to execute with value param set to a non zero value revert
        vm.expectRevert();
        sub.execute(identity, hex"deadbeef", 1 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement within Subaccount.sol logic to enable the user to deposit and withdraw ETH from the contract and make `execute()` a payable function.
