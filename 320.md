# BTC/USD chainlink oracle directly used to price WBTC without accounting for risks of WBTC depegs

## Summary
In JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol, BTC/USD chainlink oracle is directly used to Price WBTC. When WBTC depegs and unbacked in value, this leads to collaterals overvalued in the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
WBTC shouldn't be considered equivalent of BTC and the risks of WBTC depegs should be accounted for. WBTC is only as safe as its often time centralized custodians or a smart contract bridge. When a breach occurs in either case, WBTC will lose peg and might drop considerably in value. Think of the wormhole attack where WETH was minted with no backing ETH. Furthermore, there are already recent incidents where WBTC continually traded as a discounted price to BTC following the collapse of FTX. 

In JUSD, WBTC can deposited as collaterals. When WBTC's value is calculated, JOJOOracleAdaptor.sol would call BTC/USD chainlink oracle for BTC price in `getAssetPrice`. In JUSD's arbitrum testnet deployment, we can also see BTC/USD chainlink oracle(0x6550bc2301936011c1334555e62A87705A81C12C) is the oracle saved in WBTC reserve.

## Impact
The protocol might take on a large amount of bad debt and become insolvent should WBTC bridge become compromised and WBTC depegs.

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }

## Recommendation
Use a secondary liquidity based oracle to cross check prices.
