# `JUSDBank.sol#withdraw` can be exploited to bypass `maxColBorrowPerAccount`

## Summary

`JUSDBank.sol#withdraw` can be exploited to bypass `maxColBorrowPerAccount`

## Vulnerability Detail

After the `borrow` and `withdraw` operations, the health of the position will be checked. Use `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` and `_isAccountSafe` respectively to check position health. The difference between `_isAccountSafeAfterBorrow` and `_isAccountSafe` is that the former will consider `maxColBorrowPerAccount` when calculating the collateral value, while the latter will not.

For example, if Alias wants to borrow money, the `maxColBorrowPerAccount` limit of ETH is 100 USD. When Alias despoit ETH worth 120 USD, he can only borrow 100 JUSD (assuming the loan collateral ratio is 100%) because the part exceeding `maxColBorrowPerAccount` will not be calculated.

But Alias can use `withdraw` to bypass this limitation:

1. Alias despoit 120 USD worth of ETH and 20 USDC
2. Alias can borrow 100 JUSD (with ETH as collateral) + 20 JUSD (with USDC as collateral)
3. Alias withdraws 20 USDC (`maxColBorrowPerAccount` is not considered for withdraw)

Alias bypasses the `maxColBorrowPerAccount` of ETH.

## Impact

bypass `maxColBorrowPerAccount`, increase risk

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use same health check functions everywhere
