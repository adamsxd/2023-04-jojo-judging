# users can bypass maxColBorrowPerAccount

## Summary
Each account has a maximum limit for borrowing JUSD against each collateral, but it can be bypassed quite easily. 
The limit is only checked when the user calls `borrow()`, so one can exceed the limit by borrowing the maximum amount against collateral A, depositing collateral B, borrowing against it, and then withdrawing collateral B. 
The user account remains safe because there is enough col A while the maximum borrowing limit for col A is bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. consider ETH and USDC as collateral.
  * ETH, USDC maxColBorrowPerAccount = 1 million JUSD
  * ETH price = 1000$
  * ETH, USDC mortgage rate = 1 (for simplicity)
2. User deposits 2000 ETH
  * on paper he can borrow 2000*1000 = 2m JUSD
  * but because of max cap, user can only borrow 1m JUSD
3. User borrows 1m JUSD (max borrow amount)

**NOW to bypass the limit:**

5. User deposits 1m USDC as collateral (can be a flash loan)
6. User borrows another 1m JUSD (userTotalBorrow = 2m)
8. User withdraws 1m USDC
  * the account still will be safe since:  
    *  UserTotalBorrow < sum(collateralAmount∗price∗initialMortgageRate)
    *  2m JUSD  <=  2000 ETH* 1000

So now the use has 2000 ETH as collateral and has borrowed 2m JUSD
while the maxColBorrowPerAccount is 1 million

## Impact
users can bypass maxColBorrowPerAccount

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```diff
consider max mint amount for collateral on withdraw and also flashloan:
function withdraw(
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external override nonReentrant nonFlashLoanReentrant{
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
        _withdraw(amount, collateral, to, msg.sender, isInternal);
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        require(
-            _isAccountSafe(user, tRate),
+           _isAccSafeAfterBorrow(user, tRate),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
    }
