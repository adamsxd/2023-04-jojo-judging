# One Perpetual market can block updating Funding rate for other markets

## Summary
FundingRateUpdateLimiter has the updateFundingRate function maintained at dealer level, which loops through a list of perpectual list and update the funding rate for each perpectual market.
The updating logic looks for the amount of change and incase of change greater than max change, exists the loop incase any one of the markets has large variation. This will  impact all other perpectual as they are not getting updated as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
If there was a perpectual market setup with a bad market price source leading to variation in price not acceptable, all the other perpectual markets will get impacted as they will not be updated in timely manner.

It is also possible that an evil player creates a perpectual market that qualifies this failure and prevent every other market to not update due to this logical error.

## Impact
FundingRate is the premisis of this exchange and it would impact if the funding rate is not managed for perpectual markets. As an evil player, there is a potential to break this updating logic for fundingRate.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the FundingRateUpdateLimiter.updateFundingRate(), create a list of perpectual contracts that are qualifed to have this fundingRates updates while ignoring those that are disqualified due to large variation.

In the loop, insert the qualified perpectual contracts and their rates into another arrays as below.
and after completing the loop, call the updateFundingRate for the dealer  as below.

IDealer(dealer).updateFundingRate(qualifiedPerpList, qualifiedRateList);

This way, all the other perpectual markets keeps this funding rate upto date.
