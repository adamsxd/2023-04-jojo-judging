# FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan function doesn't check for slippage

## Summary
FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan function doesn't check for slippage, so user can loose funds while swapping on external party.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user liquidates position, then `JOJOFlashLoan` function [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L486) to the `flashloanAddress`.
JOJO team has created contract `FlashLoanLiquidate` that can be used as `flashloanAddress` by users, without need to create their own.

This contract receives liquidated collateral and [then swaps it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanLiquidate.sol#L62) no matter how in order to receive USDC.
The problem is that this contract doesn't check slippage as it's done in the [`FlashLoanRepay` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/flashloanImpl/FlashLoanRepay.sol#L54) for example and slippage param even is [not provided to the callback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L486-L491).
Because of that, `FlashLoanLiquidate` can't control how much funds he received after the swap and user can lose funds and his [assumption about liquidation price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L171-L177) can be wrong.
## Impact
Lose of funds while swapping.

## Recommendation
I believe that you can use same approach as in `FlashLoanRepay` and `GeneralRepay` contracts and provide slippage param.
