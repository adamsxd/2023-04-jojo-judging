# `FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan()` does not have slippage protection for liquidator



## Summary
`FlashLoanLiquidate.JOJOFlashLoan()` is missing slippage check for the collateral swap, causing liquidator to potentially receive less profit from the liquidation.


## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidator is not fully protected from slippage for the requested collateral.

In `JUSDBank.liquidate()` The liquidator is able to specify `expectPrice` for the collateral for slippage protection.

However, the `expectPrice` is only enforced at the intermediate step before the flashloan operation.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L171-L177
```Solidity
        require(
        // condition: actual liquidate price < max buy price,
        // price lower, better
            (liquidateData.insuranceFee + liquidateData.actualLiquidated).decimalDiv(liquidateData.actualCollateral)
                <= expectPrice,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATION_PRICE_PROTECTION
        );
```

As the flashloan operation will perform a swap of the collateral to USDC via an external protocol, the liquidator will be exposed to sandwich attacks and be compensated less than `expectPrice`. That is because the swap price could be different from the oracle price.

```Solidity
       //swapContract swap
        (LiquidateData memory liquidateData, bytes memory originParam) = abi
            .decode(param, (LiquidateData, bytes));
        (
            address approveTarget,
            address swapTarget,
            address liquidator,
            bytes memory data
        ) = abi.decode(originParam, (address, address, address, bytes));
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);
        if (success == false) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }

        uint256 USDCAmount = IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(this));
        //@audit - missing slippage check after swap
```


This is also not consistent with `FlashLoanRepay.sol`, which provides slippage protection by checking `USDCAmount >= minReceive` after swapping the flash loan collateral to USDC.

## Impact
As there is no complete slippage protection, liquidators could suffer loss due to less profit received from the liquidation.
