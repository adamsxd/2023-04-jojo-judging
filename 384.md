# Better to use rate based fundingRate calculation

## Summary

The current funding rate mechanism does not take into account the duration of the position being opened. A position opened at the beginning of the funding cycle and the end of the cycle will pay/receive same funding amount, which could be inaccurate and unfair.

## Vulnerability Detail

Funding rate is updated every 8 hours manually by the owner, and will be applied to the position when settled.

82:     function updateFundingRate(int256 newFundingRate) external onlyOwner {
83:         int256 oldFundingRate = fundingRate;
84:         fundingRate = newFundingRate;
85:         emit UpdateFundingRate(oldFundingRate, newFundingRate);
86:     }

182:     function _settle(
183:         address trader,
184:         int256 paperChange,
185:         int256 creditChange
186:     ) internal {
187:         bool isNewPosition = balanceMap[trader].paper == 0;
188:         int256 rate = fundingRate; // gas saving
189:         int256 credit = int256(balanceMap[trader].paper).decimalMul(rate) +
190:             int256(balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit) +
191:             creditChange;
192:         int128 newPaper = balanceMap[trader].paper +
193:             SafeCast.toInt128(paperChange);
194:         int128 newReducedCredit = SafeCast.toInt128(
195:             credit - int256(newPaper).decimalMul(rate)
196:         );
197:         balanceMap[trader].paper = newPaper;
198:         balanceMap[trader].reducedCredit = newReducedCredit;
```

Imagine, BTC price stays the same as 30,000. 
- at 08:00, the owner `updateFundingRate()`. 
- at 08:01, Alice opens a long position of 100 paper of BTC at the beginning of the funding cycle. 
- at 15:59, Bob opens the same amount of long position at the end of the cycle
- at 16:00, the owner call `updateFundingRate()` to decrease the rate. 
Now if they close the position and settle, Alice and Bob need to pay funding to short positions. Assuming the value is 0.0008, then they both need to pay 30,000 * 100 * 0.0008 = 2,400. But the amount is not fair for Alice and Bob. Alice has hold the position for 8 hours, she should pay 2,400 for funding. But Bob only has the position for 1 min.

If the funding rate is increased, the above will be the opposite, they both receive some fund, however, Bob seems to get the fund suddenly "for free", since he only hold the position for 1 min.


## Impact

The funding rate could lead to unfair amount of transfer between users. Late trader during the funding cycle could be over charged or receive undeserved fund.

## Recommendation

Implement a rate based method to calculate funding, take into account how long the position is opened.
