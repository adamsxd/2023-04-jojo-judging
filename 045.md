# Internal withdrawal to smart contract can cause a loss of funds in JUSDBank

## Summary
Internal withdrawal to smart contract can cause a loss of funds in JUSDBank.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can call ```withdraw``` method in the ```JUSDBank.sol``` and pass a smart contract as a ```to``` parameter. If this smart contract does not support working with ```JUSDBank``` funds are lost forever to the user as only the internal accounting is done. When withdrawing internally (isInternal  = true) only the  ```toAccount.depositBalance[collateral]``` is updated for the ```to``` address.

If smart contract passed as a ```to``` parameter does not support working with the JUSDBank those funds are lost for the user and will be eventually liquidated. User can't execute ```withdraw``` collateral from the smart contract as its code does not support it.
## Impact
Users can lose funds when executing an internal withdrawal to the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check in internal withdrawal if the recipient is a smart contract and has an interface implemented. Similar to how ERC721 solves this problem. This will force users to write smart contracts that support working with the JUSDBank to avoid losing funds. This check should also be added in the deposit function.

    return bytes4(bytes32(keccak256(abi.encodeWithSignature("supportsJUSDBank()"))));
