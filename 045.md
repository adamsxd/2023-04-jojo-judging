# Owner straight up stealing USDC

## Summary
Owner is getting free USDC when users interact with ```JUSDExchange```
## Vulnerability Detail
When users interact with the ```buyJUSD``` in the ```JUSDExchange.sol``` they exchange the USDC for JUSD. But all of the USDC provided by the user is going straight to the owner EOA account. This doesn't feel right as the owner can get millions and millions dollars worth of USDC making liquidity in the liquidity pools suffer because we don't know if that USDC will be allocated towards the ```JUSD-USDC``` liquidity pool. 

Also if the owner of JUSD contract is the same EOA, the owner can just print more JUSD for users to buy at the exchange hence getting more USDC.
## Impact
Users are giving free USDC to the owner and have presumably low liquidity to exchange from JUSD to USDC.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The USDC should stay in the JUSDExchange. The contract should have a sell function that sells JUSD to USDC.
