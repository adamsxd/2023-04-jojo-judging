# Inconsistent Decimal Handling in JUSDBank Liquidation `expectPrice` for WETH and WBTC Collateral


## Summary

An inconsistency exists in the `expectPrice` input variable's decimals for WETH and WBTC collateral in the `JUSDBank.liquidate()` function.
WETH collateral uses 1e6 decimals, while WBTC collateral employs 1e16 decimals.
This discrepancy causes issues with the `expectPrice` require check for BTC collateral.
It may be more appropriate to use 1e6 decimals for both collateral types, as 1e6 decimal conversions are applied in other parts of the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

```js
    require(
    // condition: actual liquidate price < max buy price,
    // price lower, better
        (liquidateData.insuranceFee + liquidateData.actualLiquidated).decimalDiv(liquidateData.actualCollateral)
            <= expectPrice,
        JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATION_PRICE_PROTECTION
    );
```

`insuranceFee` and `actualLiquidated` represent the total liquidation amount in JUSD based on the liquidator's `amount` input.
`actualCollateral` is in collateral decimals, which is 1e8 for WBTC.
The `decimalDiv()` function divides by a fixed value `a * 1e18 / b`, resulting in an extra 10 decimals for WBTC compared to normal, while WETH remains unaffected.

## Impact

Confusing price decimals might cause liquidations to revert due to the price protection check.

For WETH, $2000 = 2000e6.
For WBTC, $22000 = 22000e16.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since `expectPrice` is used solely to ensure liquidation amounts stay within a 5% price discount and profit for the liquidator, and the `FlashLoanLiquidate.sol` helper contract likely utilizes the Uniswap router to trade collateral for USDC (which also has slippage protection), the `expectPrice` check for liquidation could be deemed unnecessary.
Removing it should not negatively impact regular users.
