# Subaccount is expected to be able to send ETH but doesn't have any payable functions to receive ETH

## Summary
Subaccount is expected to be able to send ETH but doesn't have any payable functions to receive ETH.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/main/contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol#L45
```solidity
function execute(address to, bytes calldata data, uint256 value) external onlyOwner returns (bytes memory){
        require(to != address(0));
        (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = to.call{value: value}(data);
        if (!success) {
            assembly {
                let ptr := mload(0x40)
                let size := returndatasize()
                returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                revert(ptr, size)
            }
        }
        emit ExecuteTransaction(owner, address(this), to, data, value);
        return returnData;
    }
```

The `execute` function is used for Subaccount to perform any transaction, including sending value operations. However, there are no `receive` or `payable` functions in the Subaccount, which makes it unable to receive native currency and therefore cannot be sent in execute.
## Impact
Native currency cannot be sent.

## Recommendation
Add a receive or payable function.
