# Should check same size for all arrays in trade function to prevent gas wastage

## Summary
Should check same size for all arrays in trade function

## Vulnerability Detail
See Perpetual#trade,

```solidity
 function trade(bytes calldata tradeData) external {
        (
            address[] memory traderList,
            int256[] memory paperChangeList,
            int256[] memory creditChangeList
        ) = IDealer(owner()).approveTrade(msg.sender, tradeData);

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < traderList.length; ) {
            _settle(traderList[i], paperChangeList[i], creditChangeList[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        require(IDealer(owner()).isAllSafe(traderList), "TRADER_NOT_SAFE");
    }
```

There is no checking that traderList, paperChangeList and creditChangeList have the same array size

## Impact
If the traderList size has a greater array size, system will revert all the transaction and gas is spent. The gas amount will be significant when traderList size reach thousand or more

## Recommendation
Ensure traderList, paperChangeList and creditChangeList have the same array size in Perpetual#trade function
