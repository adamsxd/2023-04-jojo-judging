# Uniswap oracle is not advised to be used on L2s

## Summary
Uniswap advises developers not to use Uniswap oracle on L2s as price feeds are much easier to be manipulated. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The quoted [statement](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/oracle#oracles-integrations-on-layer-2-rollups) made from the Uniswap team is regarding integration on L2 Optimism, where every transaction is a different block, however, it is also valid for Arbitrum, as the average block time on Arbitrum is ~0.25s.

> ### Oracles Integrations on Layer 2 Rollups
> Optimism
On Optimism, every transaction is confirmed as an individual block. The block.timestamp of these blocks, however, reflect the block.timestamp of the last L1 block ingested by the Sequencer. For this reason, Uniswap pools on Optimism are not suitable for providing oracle prices, as this high-latency block.timestamp update process makes the oracle much less costly to manipulate. In the future, it's possible that the Optimism block.timestamp will have much higher granularity (with a small trust assumption in the Sequencer), or that forced inclusion transactions will improve oracle security. For more information on these potential upcoming changes, please see the [Optimistic Specs repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-specs/discussions/23). **For the time being, usage of the oracle feature on Optimism should be avoided.**
