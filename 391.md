# getMaxWithdrawAmount returns USDC amount not collateral amount

## Summary
According to comments, `getMaxWithdrawAmount` should return how much collateral can be safely withdraw. 
Instead it returns wrong value (much bigger) because multiply an JUSD amount with collateral price.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
            uint256 remainAmount = (maxMintAmount - JUSDBorrow).decimalDiv(
                reserve.initialMortgageRate.decimalMul(
                    IPriceChainLink(reserve.oracle).getAssetPrice()
                )
            );
```
`remainAmount` is the difference between how much an user can borrow with his collateral and how much he already borrowed. 
For 1 ETH collateral @2000 USD/ETH and 0.7 `initialMortgageRate`' an user can borrow 1 * 2000 * 0.7 = 1400  JUSD
Let's suppose he already borrowed  1000 JUSD. 
`remainAmount =  maxMintAmount - JUSDBorrow) / initialMortgageRate * price`
remainAmount  =  (1400 - 1000) / 0.7 * 2000 = *1.142.857* JUSD

## Impact
Even if this function doesn't change balances, if other protocols integrates JUSDBank and rely on `getMaxWithdrawAmount` funds can be lost, thus I consider this as M severity.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Divide the amount with price instead of multiplying with it. 

```solidity
            uint256 remainAmount = (maxMintAmount - JUSDBorrow).decimalDiv(
                reserve.initialMortgageRate.decimalDiv(
                    IPriceChainLink(reserve.oracle).getAssetPrice()
                )
            );
```

Given above example now we have:
400 / 0.7 / 2000 = 0.2857 (Ether)
