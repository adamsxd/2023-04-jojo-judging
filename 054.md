# DepositStableCoinToDealer contract's depositStableCoin() will execute for 0 amount

## Summary
DepositStableCoinToDealer contract does not check for amount to be non-zero and hence could process the whole business logic without changing the state.
To do so, but amount and minReceive should be passed as 0.

A deposit event will be fired  with 0 value, but infact there is no actual movement of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Unnecessary event notification to offchain systems and spending of gas without any effective change in state. 

## Impact
Essentially a low impact as this only leads to an unwanted event, although the event is telling a 0 deposit amount. Unnessary spending of gas is the only economic affect and could be fixed with minor changes.
