# `requestWithdraw` has bad UX

## Summary

The logic in `Funding.sol` means that if a user has an executable withdrawal and requests another withdrawal, their initial executable withdrawal is overridden, and they are forced to wait for the time period again.

## Vulnerability Detail

This issue occurs in the `requestWithdraw` function, where the `state.pendingPrimaryWithdraw` and `state.pendingSecondaryWithdraw` values are overwritten for the user without checking if they have a pending executable withdrawal.

## Impact

As a result, the previous withdrawal amount is lost, and the user has to wait for the new withdrawal's time-lock period to pass before being able to execute it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this bug, implement a check in the `requestWithdraw` function to ensure that a user's pending executable withdrawal is not overridden if they request another withdrawal. 

This would prevent the loss of the initial withdrawal amount and improve the user experience.
