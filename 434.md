# Faulty Logic in Trader Sorting (Medium severity issue)


[https://github.com/JOJOexchange/smart-contract-EVM/blob/4a95a8e9a6367ae88dc827e29467229cb5bbad4f/contracts/lib/Trading.sol#L62](url)
The logic that checks if traders are sorted in the approveTrade function is flawed. The condition `orderList[i].signer > orderList[i - 1].signer ` is used to increment the `uniqueTraderNum` , it seems to assume that the signers are ordered in a ascending order, however `.signer` is an ethereum address. 

This faulty logic check might cause the contract unable to deliver transaction because of address mismatch.

It might be more appropriate to use != instead of >. This way the contract will be able to match order regardless of the address ordering.

```solidity


if (orderList[i].signer != orderList[i - 1].signer) { 
    uniqueTraderNum = uniqueTraderNum + 1;
} else {
    require(
        orderList[i].signer == orderList[i - 1].signer,
        Errors.ORDER_WRONG_SORTING
    );
}
```
