# In certain cases, although the user has repaid the debt, their debt record is not updated.

## Summary
Due to rounding errors for the calculation `t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate)`, although the user has repaid the debt, their debt record is not updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `JUSDBank.repay()` function allows user to repay JUSD debt from the payer address to the to address, with the amount of debt and exchange rate determining the amount of t0BorrowBalance and tBorrowAmount to be repaid. Inside the function, it calculates the amount of JUSD that was borrowed by the user using the tRate exchange rate, and determines the amount of t0BorrowBalance and tBorrowAmount to repay based on whether the JUSDBorrowed is less than or equal to amount.
```solidity
    if (JUSDBorrowed <= amount) {
            tBorrowAmount = JUSDBorrowed;
            t0Amount = user.t0BorrowBalance;
        } else {
            tBorrowAmount = amount;
            t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate);
        }
        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), tBorrowAmount);
        user.t0BorrowBalance -= t0Amount;
        t0TotalBorrowAmount -= t0Amount;
```
`tRate` is calculated based on below function.
```solidity
    function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return
            t0Rate +
            (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
            JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }
```
t0Rate is JOJOConstant.ONE (1e18), hence, `tRate`  is greater than 1e18. Here is the probolem,if a user has very small amount of tokens to repay, t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate) will be 0, causing the protocol to withdraw a small amount of assets from the user to repay the debt. However, user.t0BorrowBalance and t0TotalBorrowAmount will be reduced by 0, and the user's debt record will not be updated.


## Impact
Although the user has repaid the debt, their debt record is not updated.
