# `FundingRateUpdateLimiter.sol#updateFundingRate` may be used by ordersender to sandwich attacks

## Summary

`FundingRateUpdateLimiter.sol#updateFundingRate` may be used by ordersender to sandwich attacks

## Vulnerability Detail

The JOJO team will update the `fundingRate` every 8 hours, because the `fundingRate` affects the actual trade price. Ordersender may use this mechanism to arbitrage (because there is no trader fee for ordersender).

1. Alias detects that the `fundingRate` is about to be updated and will cause the price to increase
2. Alias opens a long position
3. Admin call `updateFundingRate` and the price increase
4. Alias close the position and earn

## Impact

exploited for arbitrage
