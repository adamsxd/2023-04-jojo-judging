# Users cannot borrow in the JUSDBank and buy JUSD in JUSDExchange when JUSDBank and JUSDExchange run out of JUSD

## Summary

JUSD is transferred into JUSDBank and JUSDExchange by the owner of JUSD token contract. If the JUSDBank and JUSDExchange run out of JUSD, users cannot borrow JUSD in bank or buy JUSD in exchange.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user borrows or buy JUSD, JUSD is transferred from JUSDBank / JUSDExchange to the user address.

        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransfer(to, tAmount);

If the JUSDBank or JUSDExchange runs out of JUSD or has a JUSD balance less than the amount, the function will revert. To avoid this case, when a user borrows or buys, the JUSD should be minted directly to the user account. This also improves the decentralization since the minting and burning are done by the code instead of the owner who can mint and burn unlimited amount and has to track the balance of JUSD bank/exchange and transfer to the bank/exchange contract when the JUSD balance is low.

## Impact

The borrow function of JUSDBank and buy function of JUSDExchange are disabled.

## Recommendation

When a user borrows in bank or buys in exchange, mint JUSD directly to the user account instead of transferring the token from JUSD bank to the user account.
