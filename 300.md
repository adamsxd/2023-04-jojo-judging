# Lack of L2 Sequencer downtime handling in price oracle update could result in unfair liquidation for JUSD borrowers

## Summary

Both `JOJOOracleAdapter.sol` and `chainlinkAdapter.sol` do not handle the scenario where Arbitrum's sequencer recovers from downtime, causing unfair liquidation for JUSD borrowers.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the Arbitrum L2 Sequencer goes down and come back online, all the Chainlink oracle's delayed price updates that occurred during downtime will be processed at once. It will be chaotic if the price updates are significant as mass liquidations (usually by bots) will occur before borrowers could repay.

Also, when Arbitrum is down, it is still possible for anyone to submit a transaction for L2 through L1 via the delayed inbox mechanism. A savvy borrower could exploit these delayed transactions to try to save their positions. However, normal borrowers might not be aware of it/have access to it, which then creates an unfair disadvantage for them.

## Impact
Both the delayed oracle price updates and delayed inbox mechanisms will cause unfair liquidations to normal JUSD borrowers, who are not aware and could not repay their debt in time when Arbitrum's sequencer recovers.

## Recommendation

Incorporate checks for sequencer uptime. Consider providing a grace period before resuming liquidation/borrowing when the sequencer recovers from a downtime.
https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code

For the Aave Protocol, the liquidation grace period is provided for positions that are not heavily undercollateralized.
