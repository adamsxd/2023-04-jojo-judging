# No reentrancy protection for the deposit, requestWithdraw, and executeWithdraw functions

## Summary

The deposit, requestWithdraw, and executeWithdraw functions in Funding.sol lack reentrancy protection, which may expose them to reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The deposit, requestWithdraw, and executeWithdraw functions in Funding.sol interact with external contracts (ERC20 tokens) without implementing reentrancy protection. This could potentially allow a malicious token contract to exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities.

## Impact

If a reentrancy attack is successful, it may result in unexpected behavior, such as loss of funds, double withdrawals, or other undesirable outcomes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement reentrancy protection using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard library or a similar solution. Modify the vulnerable functions to include the `nonReentrant` parameter.
