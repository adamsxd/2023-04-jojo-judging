# Bypass withdrawal delay in `executeWithdraw()` function


## Summary
When users want to withdraw assets, they have to call `requestWithdraw()` to set the `withdrawExecutionTimestamp` state with `block.timestamp` + `state.withdrawTimeLock`. They then need to wait for the specified time to pass and call the `executeWithdraw()` function to withdraw their assets. However, this mechanism can be bypassed by calling the `requestWithdraw()` function in advance. If the user wants to withdraw their assets, they can execute the `executeWithdraw()` function and pass the `withdrawExecutionTimestamp` validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check between the withdrawal amount and user balance in the `requestWithdraw()` function.

This means that a user can call the `requestWithdraw()` function in advance with an amount that they need to withdraw. They can then withdraw the asset with that amount by calling the `executeWithdraw()` function when they have the required asset to withdraw.

## Impact
The withdrawal process allows any users to bypass the waiting period.
