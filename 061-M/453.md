# Interest rate drifts over time, upto 5% in the first year

## Summary

Interest calculation for JOJOBank shows drift.

## Vulnerability Detail

The interest is calculated in JOJOBank and this is used to change the amount of debt, and collect interest. This formulation however has some issues, and a better method is suggested.

The contract keeps track of two quantities: The amount, `tAmount` and the current rate, `tRate`.
For each user, the contract keeps track of their current rate adjusted Debt, `user.t0BorrowBalance` defined as the `amount/currentRate`. This is shown in the following snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L281-L287

When calculating the debt of an account, the contract multiplies this stored value with the current rate.

This however shows some issues as time goes on. The rate is defined as `R0 + time_difference/SECS_IN_YEAR * stable_rate`. This is defined in function `getTRate`.

```solidity
uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
return
    t0Rate +
    (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
    JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
```

Lets assume some numbers. Let's assume the stable rate is 5%, and the amount borrowed is A. Lets assume the scenario starts the moment the contract is deployed. At this instant, `rate = t0Rate`, which is defined as 1e18. Thus rate = 1. And when the borrow happens, the contract stores the value `A/1` in the variable `user.t0BorrowBalance`. At the end of 1 year, the debt is calculated as stored value * current rate. `current rate = 1e18 + 5e16`, so current_rate is 1.05 due to the stable rate of 5%. Thus the debt is calculated as `A*1.05 = 1.05A`, which is the correct amount.

Now lets shift the scenario to the second year. Now, since the first year has passed, the value of the current rate is now 1.05 already. User now takes a debt of amount A, accruing the value `A/1.05` in the variable `user.t0BorrowBalance`. When coming back to return the funds at the end of the second year, the current rate is calculated as 1.10, due to the steady rate of 5%. Now, the debt is calculated as `A/1.05*1.10 = 1.0476A`, which is lower than the correct 5% rate by almost 4.8%. This drift will continue to increase as time goes on.

The debt is calculated as `A/R1*R2`, where R1 is the rate at time of borrow, and R2 is the rate now. R2 is related to R1 by the formula `R2 = R1 + time_difference/SECONDS_IN_YEAR * stable_rate`. Thus the actual debt can be simplified to `Debt = A * (1 + time_difference/SECONDS_IN_YEAR * stable_rate / R1)`. The extra R1 term in the end is the root cause of the problem. If `R1 = 1`, then this issue does not exist, which is the scenario where the contract has just been deployed. The larger R1 grows, thet is the later a debt has been taken out, the lower the interest they need to pay. This is because the actual simple interest formula is close, but without the extra R1 term. `Actual Debt = A * (1 + time_difference/SECONDS_IN_YEAR * stable_rate)`. This actual formula will show no drift over time.

## Impact

Incorrect interest rate calculations as time goes on.

## Code Snippet

Can be demonstrated with a simple test. A borrow is done in year 0 and paid in year 1. Similar borrow done in year 1 and paid in year 2. Second borrow pays lower interest rate.

The following test shows the different interest rates:

```solidity
function testAttackRate() public {
    mockToken1.transfer(alice, 100e18);

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    mockToken1.approve(address(jusdBank), type(uint256).max);
    jusd.approve(address(jusdBank), type(uint256).max);
    jusdBank.deposit(alice, address(mockToken1), 10e18, alice);

    // First borrow
    jusdBank.borrow(5000e6, alice, false);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    uint256 borrowBalanceFirst = jusdBank.getBorrowBalance(alice);
    emit log_named_uint("borrowBalanceFirst", borrowBalanceFirst);
    deal(address(jusd), alice, borrowBalanceFirst);
    jusdBank.repay(borrowBalanceFirst, alice);

    // Second Borrow
    jusdBank.borrow(5000e6, alice, false);
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    uint256 borrowBalanceSecond = jusdBank.getBorrowBalance(alice);
    emit log_named_uint("borrowBalanceSecond", borrowBalanceSecond);
}
```

The mock price feeds were changed so that the `updatedAt` is equal to the current timestamp, or the test gives the heartbeat error. The following is the output of the test:

```bash
Running 1 test for test/Impl/JUSDBankRepay.t.sol:JUSDBankRepayTest
[PASS] testAttackRate() (gas: 532652)
Logs:
  borrowBalanceFirst: 5100000000
  borrowBalanceSecond: 5098039216

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; finished in 17.74ms
```

This shows that the interest rate keeps decreasing as time goes on even for equal intervals.

Foundry

## Recommendation

Instead of tracking `A/rate`, track `A` and `A*rate`. This will ensure that the interest rate is calculated correctly for every interval. To calcaulate the debt, use the formula `Debt = A + (A*rate)_new - (A*rate)_old`, where current rate is calculated the same way as is done now, and borrow rate is the rate at the time of borrow. This will consistently give the same rate even when the starting times are different.
