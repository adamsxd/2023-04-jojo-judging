# The function `handleBadDebt` from `Liquidation.sol` can be easily front-runnable by the liquidated trader

## Summary
The function `handleBadDebt` can be easily front-runnable and not usable most of the time.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `handleBadDebt` has an if statement https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L402-L405 which require both statements to be true to run. If the first statement is true then the function `_isSafe` calls `getTotalExposure` with the `state.openPositions[liquidatedTrader].length` equal to 0 which makes it so the for statement never to run, returning 0 for `netPositionValue` and `maintenanceMargin`. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L63-L83
In that case the return value from `_isSafe` will be `state.primaryCredit[trader]` + `state.secondaryCredit[trader]` >= 0 which will return false only if `state.primaryCredit[trader]` is negative, but this can be easily avoidable by the liquidated trader if he front-runs the transaction by depositing some primary/secondary credit so the addition will be 0 or positive. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L99-L103
## Impact
The impact of this severity is a medium one since the function will not be usable most of the time because the if statement will not be true most of the times.

## Recommendation
Change the logic of the function or change the if statement so the function can be usable
