# chainlinkAdaptor.sol allows an oracle heartbeat expiration bypass

## Summary

The chainlinkAdaptor contract uses two oracles, one for the token price and the other for the USDC price. The contract calculates the mark price using the latest answer of each oracle. The contract is designed to revert if the latest answer of either oracle is older than the heartbeat interval. However, it is possible to bypass the heartbeat check by setting the block timestamp to an earlier time than the oracle's updatedAt field.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability exists in the getMarkPrice() function. The function gets the latest answer of each oracle and reverts if either oracle's latest answer is older than the heartbeat interval. The block timestamp is used to check if the oracle is still up-to-date. However, the block timestamp can be manipulated by miners, and this allows attackers to bypass the heartbeat check. An attacker can set the block timestamp to an earlier time than the oracle's updatedAt field to make the oracle appear to be up-to-date, even though its answer is stale.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate the chainlinkAdaptor contract to return stale or incorrect mark prices, which can be used to exploit the JOJO system for financial gain. This vulnerability can result in severe financial losses for the JOJO system and its users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The getMarkPrice() function should be modified to use the block number rather than the block timestamp for checking the oracle's heartbeat. The block number is deterministic and cannot be manipulated by miners, making it a better choice for this purpose. By using the block number instead of the block timestamp, the chainlinkAdaptor contract will be more resilient to timestamp manipulation attacks.

Example code:
```solidity
function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
    int256 rawPrice;
    uint256 updatedAt;
    uint256 currentBlockNumber = block.number;
    (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
    (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
    require(
        currentBlockNumber - SafeCast.toUint256(updatedAt) <= heartbeatInterval,
        "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
    );
    require(currentBlockNumber - SafeCast.toUint256(USDCUpdatedAt) <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
    uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
    return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
}
