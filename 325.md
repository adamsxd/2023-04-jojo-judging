# There's no maximum cap on the insurance's borrow balance.

## Summary
There is no limit on the borrow balance of the insurance address, thus exposing the insurance(controlled by JOJO) to potential risk.

## Vulnerability Detail
The project has added variables like `maxDepositAmountPerAccount`, and `maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` to reduce the risk exposure of the Jojo team. For example, `maxDepositAmountPerAccount` is used to prevent users from depositing too many assets, thereby preventing borrowing too much JUSD, and reducing JOJO's risk exposure. Also, the `_borrow` function of the JUSDBank contract has a [check](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L296) to ensure that an account does not borrow over `maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` limit.

But, there is no such check on the insurance address. In the [`_handleBadDebt`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L496), there is no check on the `t0BorrowBalance` on the insurance address. A check similar to `user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate) <= maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` (as seen in the [`_borrow`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L296) function) needs to be applied to insurance as well. 

## Impact
The insurance address is controlled by JOJO. Without a check, there is no limit on the amount of `t0BorrowBalance` that the insurance account can take. Thus exposing the JOJO team to a lot of potential risks when there are enough bad debts.

## Code Snippet
The [`_handleBadDebt`](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L496) function of JUSDBank contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When the contract already makes use of `maxDepositAmountPerAccount`, and `maxPerAccountBorrowAmount` to reduce exposure, it is recommended to use another variable like `maxInsuranceAccountBorrowAmount` and the following check needs to be added in the `_handleBadDebt` function:

`require(insuranceInfo.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate) <= maxInsuranceAccountBorrowAmount)`
