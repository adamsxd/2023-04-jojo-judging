# User can be censored by trade order sender

## Summary
User can be censored by trade executor. As result his orders will not be executed and he can face losses. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In JOJO system, only `validOrderSender` [can execute trading](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/impl/JOJOExternal.sol#L112-L115).

This makes possible to censor specific user for that sender. As result user will not be able to trade and control his positions and he can become liquidatable and face losses.
## Impact
User can't trade.
