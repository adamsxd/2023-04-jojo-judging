# anyone can call init() function

## Summary
anyone can call init() function as access control is missing.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
In Subaccount.sol, init() function can be called by anyone as init() function visibility is external with no access control. This could lead to a race condition when the contract is deployed. At that moment a hacker or attacker could call the init() function and make the deployed contracts useless. Then it would have to be redeployed again which will be costing a lot of gas.

If the attacker calls init() on a contract that has already been referenced by a previous contract, the attacker causes that contract to be rendered useless as well. Since init() can only be called once, and then it is locked forever, a successful attack leaves the entire contract useless.

## Code Snippet
In Subaccount.sol, 

```solidity
File: contracts/subaccount/Subaccount.sol

39    function init(address _owner) external {
40        require(!initialized, "ALREADY INITIALIZED");
41       initialized = true;
42        owner = _owner;
43   }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a access control check to the init() function, 

For example: only the contract deployer or owner can call the init() function.
