# getAssetPrice performs division before multiplication operation

## Summary

The order of operations in getAssetPrice is rather incorrect. It performs a division before multiplication operation on the token price. However Solidity operations relating to multiplication should always be performed first, followed by the division operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The order of operations in getAssetPrice is rather incorrect. It performs a division before multiplication operation on the token price. However Solidity operations relating to multiplication should always be performed first, followed by the division operation.

Division before multiplication could result in precision loss, rounding to zero error resulting to a huge loss of funds

## Impact

Division before multiplication operation can result to precision loss, or rounding to zero error.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function getAssetPrice() external view override returns (uint256) {
        /*uint80 roundID*/
        (, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainLinkAggregator(USDCSource).latestRoundData();

        require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(price) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * JOJOConstant.ONE / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

## Recommendation

All multiplication operations should be performed first, followed by the division operation .
