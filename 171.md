# JUSDExchange.sol#L41.buyJUSD() assume that price of USDC is 1$ always

## Summary
JUSDExchange.sol#L41.buyJUSD() assume that price of USDC is 1$ always.

## Vulnerability Detail
The below function is for exchange USDC to JUSD with exchange rate 1:1 and assume that USDC price is 1$ always.

```solidity
    function buyJUSD(uint256 amount, address to) external {
        require(isExchangeOpen, JUSDErrors.NOT_ALLOWED_TO_EXCHANGE);
        IERC20(primaryAsset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, owner(), amount);
        IERC20(JUSD).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        emit BuyJUSD(amount, to, msg.sender);
    }
```
