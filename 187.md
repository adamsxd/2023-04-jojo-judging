# Unhandled revert could lock all price oracle access due to usage of only one oracle (in this case chainlink) and lack of the try/catch block



## Summary

Implementing only the chainlink oracle in the protocol is not a good idea as there is no other oracle to fall on incase a problem rises with chainlink, for examople the call to `latestRoundData()` could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. Feeds cannot be changed after they are configured so this would result in a permanent denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail

`latestRoundData()` is used all over contracts in scope, but they are not used in a try/catch block
And as we all know chainlink's multisigs can immediately block access to price feeds at will, though chances of this happening are somewhat low there is still this possibility. Therefore, to prevent denial of service scenarios, it is recommended to query Chainlink price feeds using a defensive approach with Solidityâ€™s try/catch structure. In this way, if the call to the price feed fails, the caller contract is still in control and can handle any errors safely and explicitly.
Refer to https://blog.openzeppelin.com/secure-smart-contract-guidelines-the-dangers-of-price-oracles/ for more information regarding potential risks to account for when relying on external price feed providers.

Take a look at the `getMarkPrice()` function

```solidity
    function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
```

## Impact

Impossibility to query prices, and break in multiple of protocol's logic

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Surround the call to latestRoundData() with try/catch instead of calling it directly. In a scenario where the call reverts, the catch block can be used to call a fallback oracle or handle the error in any other suitable way.
