# `JUSDBank.sol#repay` needs to repay additional interest

## Summary

`JUSDBank.sol#repay` needs to repay additional interest

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: Impl/JUSDBank.sol
307     function _repay(
308         DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
309         address payer,
310         address to,
311         uint256 amount,
312         uint256 tRate
313     ) internal returns (uint256) {
314         require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.REPAY_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
315 >>      uint256 JUSDBorrowed = user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);
316         uint256 tBorrowAmount;
317         uint256 t0Amount;
318         if (JUSDBorrowed <= amount) {
319             tBorrowAmount = JUSDBorrowed;
320             t0Amount = user.t0BorrowBalance;
321         } else {
322             tBorrowAmount = amount;
323             t0Amount = amount.decimalDiv(tRate);
324         }
325         IERC20(JUSD).safeTransferFrom(payer, address(this), tBorrowAmount);
326         user.t0BorrowBalance -= t0Amount;
327         t0TotalBorrowAmount -= t0Amount;
328         emit Repay(payer, to, tBorrowAmount);
329         return tBorrowAmount;
330     }
```

The `_repay` function executes the repayment operation, and the user needs to repay the loan multiplied by `tRate`. The problem here is that directly multiplying `tRate` will cause users to pay additional interest. The correct interest should be multiplied by (current tRate - tRate when borrowing).

For example:

1. The current tRate is 1.1, and the user borrowed 100 JUSD
2. The current tRate is 1.2, and the user returned 100 JUSD

The user theoretically needs to return 100 + (1.2 - 1.1) * 100 = 100 + 10 = 110. But according to the implementation of the current code, the user needs to return 100 * 1.2 = 120 JUSD.

## Impact

Users need to pay additional interest

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to calculate the interest according to the borrowing time

```diff
    function _repay(
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        address payer,
        address to,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 tRate
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.REPAY_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
-       uint256 JUSDBorrowed = user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate);
+       // just a demo
+       // tRate0 is the tRate when borrowing
+       uint256 JUSDBorrowed = user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(1e18 + getTRate() - tRate0);
        uint256 tBorrowAmount;
        uint256 t0Amount;
