# attacker can take more toned than deserve and cause protocol loose of funds

## Summary

an attacker can take more than his collateral amount in `JUSDbank.sol` by calling deposit and borrow and withdraw functions with different address parameters and cause the protocol loose most of the funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

the `JUSDbank` contract have this three function(deposit and borrow and withdraw) which they used to deposit collateral and borrow some JUSD token and withdraw the collateral, all of this function have `from` and `to` address which can be set by the caller/user to set the address they want to send/receive tokens using a specific address, but this can be used to drain the protocol or at least take more token than they put as collateral, in the scenario below we explain how this could happen :

1- an attacker(alice) will call the function `deposit` in JUSDbank contract to deposit some tokens as collateral, we set `from` to msg.sender or the attacker balance to add collateral to `to` address( from = msg.sender/EOA & to = an address we want to set collateral to the balance for)

```solidity
function deposit(
        address from,
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external override nonReentrant isValidOperator(msg.sender, from) {
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve = reserveInfo[collateral];
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[to];
        //        deposit
        _deposit(reserve, user, amount, collateral, to, from);
    }
```

the deposit function will call the \_deposit function to deposit balance from `from` to `to` and add the balance to the `to` balance in the `JUSDbank.sol` :

```solidity

 function _deposit(
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve,
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from
    ) internal {
        require(reserve.isDepositAllowed, JUSDErrors.RESERVE_NOT_ALLOW_DEPOSIT);
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        IERC20(collateral).safeTransferFrom(from, address(this), amount);
        _addCollateralIfNotExists(user, collateral);
        user.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
        reserve.totalDepositAmount += amount;
        require(
            user.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
        );
        require(
            reserve.totalDepositAmount <= reserve.maxTotalDepositAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_TOTAL
        );
        emit Deposit(collateral, from, to, msg.sender, amount);
    }

```

as you can see the `_deposit` function is updating the `to` balance which is the address the attacker is set it, now the balance of `from` and `to` is : for example
from == $0
to = $10,000

remember the balance of the two account above.

2-then the attacker want to borrow some token(JUSD) token by calling the `borrow` function to borrow some tokens, the attacker will set the `to` address as `msg.sender` which is `from` address that called the `deposit` function above,

`borrow` function

```solidity
 function borrow(
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bool isDepositToJOJO
    ) external override nonReentrant nonFlashLoanReentrant{
        //     t0BorrowedAmount = borrowedAmount /  getT0Rate
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
        _borrow(user, isDepositToJOJO, to, amount, msg.sender);
        require(
            _isAccountSafeAfterBorrow(user, getTRate()),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_BORROW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
    }

```

and this function will call the `_borrow` function :

```solidity
 function _borrow(
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user,
        bool isDepositToJOJO,
        address to,
        uint256 tAmount,
        address from
    ) internal {
        //audit this rate may not correct !
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        //        tAmount % tRate ？ tAmount / tRate + 1 ： tAmount % tRate
        uint256 t0Amount = tAmount.decimalRemainder(tRate)
            ? tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate)
            : tAmount.decimalDiv(tRate) + 1;
        user.t0BorrowBalance += t0Amount;
        t0TotalBorrowAmount += t0Amount;
        if (isDepositToJOJO) {
            IERC20(JUSD).approve(address(JOJODealer), tAmount);
            IDealer(JOJODealer).deposit(0, tAmount, to);
        } else {
            IERC20(JUSD).safeTransfer(to, tAmount);
        }
        // Personal account hard cap
        require(
            user.t0BorrowBalance.decimalMul(tRate) <= maxPerAccountBorrowAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_BORROW_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
        );
        // Global account hard cap
        require(
            t0TotalBorrowAmount.decimalMul(tRate) <= maxTotalBorrowAmount,
            JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_BORROW_AMOUNT_TOTAL
        );
        emit Borrow(from, to, tAmount, isDepositToJOJO);
    }

```

as we can see the `user` borrow balance is updated at `user.t0BorrowBalance += t0Amount;` which we set the `user` to user[msg.sender] and the borrow amount will transfer to the `to` address which is `from/msg.sender` address that we used in deposit function to transfer token to the `to` address and the same address that the borrow balance is updated in the `_borrow` function. now our from and to balance is like this :

from = $10,000 JUSD borrow for example
to = $10,000 collateral for example

3-now the attacker is ready to get all the token out by calling `withdraw` function by sitting the `to` address same as `msg.sender` and `userInfo[msg.sender]` by calling the the withdraw function using the `to` address that have all collateral,
the `withdraw` function :

```solidity
function withdraw(
        address collateral,
        uint256 amount,
        address to,
        bool isInternal
    ) external override nonReentrant nonFlashLoanReentrant{
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage user = userInfo[msg.sender];
        _withdraw(amount, collateral, to, msg.sender, isInternal);
        uint256 tRate = getTRate();
        require(
            _isAccountSafe(user, tRate),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_WITHDRAW_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
    }

```

this function will call `_withdraw` function :

```solidity
function _withdraw(
        uint256 amount,
        address collateral,
        address to,
        address from,
        bool isInternal
    ) internal {
        DataTypes.ReserveInfo storage reserve = reserveInfo[collateral];
        DataTypes.UserInfo storage fromAccount = userInfo[from];
        require(amount != 0, JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_ZERO);
        require(
            amount <= fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral],
            JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_TOO_BIG
        );

        fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral] -= amount;
        if (isInternal) {
            DataTypes.UserInfo storage toAccount = userInfo[to];
            _addCollateralIfNotExists(toAccount, collateral);
            toAccount.depositBalance[collateral] += amount;
            require(
                toAccount.depositBalance[collateral] <=
                    reserve.maxDepositAmountPerAccount,
                JUSDErrors.EXCEED_THE_MAX_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT_PER_ACCOUNT
            );
        } else {
            reserve.totalDepositAmount -= amount;
            IERC20(collateral).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
        emit Withdraw(collateral, from, to, amount, isInternal);
        _removeEmptyCollateral(fromAccount, collateral);
    }
```

the attacker set the `from` to the `to` address that have the collateral and he call the withdraw function with the `to` address so in this case `msg.sender and from` is same as `to` address, the `_withdraw` function will remove the amount we want to deposit in `from` address which we set as same of `to` addresss in this line :

` fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral] -= amount;`

and then the attacker set the `isInternal` boolean to false so this code will run which it transfer all the amount/our collateral to the `to` address(attacker address in this case):

```solidity
else {
            reserve.totalDepositAmount -= amount;
            IERC20(collateral).safeTransfer(to, amount);
        }
```

in this case the attacker have removed his collateral and send it to his address without paying his borrow amount and without need to call repy to repay his debt because the attacker have his collateral in his account : so the balance now is like below :

from(first attacker address) = $10,000 JUSD borrow and no need to repay it
to(another attacker address) = $10,000 worth of his collateral

this way the attacker gain 10,000 jusd token without repay it and withdrawing his collateral and he can repeat this scenario.

## Impact

the attacker can drain the protocol and can get more token out as s/he wish which cause the protocol loose of funds

manual review

## Recommendation

recommend something to prevent this case maybe is a bit complex and need to change some logic in the protocol, in my opnion i recommend to add check that `from != to` in this case the withdraw will fail in this check if from balance is zero

```solidity
require(
            amount <= fromAccount.depositBalance[collateral],
            JUSDErrors.WITHDRAW_AMOUNT_IS_TOO_BIG
        );
```

or the team can adda check in each function that check the balance and collateral of each `from` and `to` address or for the `msg.sender`

but this is not the best practice to avoid this, i recommend following the implementaion of Aave protocol v2 and v3 that they handle this case by adding only one address in the deposit and borrow and withdraw function to prevent this scenario to happen( no need to add `from` and `to` as params)
