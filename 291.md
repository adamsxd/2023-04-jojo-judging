# Diff in uniswapPriceAdaptor#getMarkPrice should be divided by the uniswapPriceFeed instead of JOJOPriceFeed

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When calculating the MarkPrice of the token, getMarkPrice() is used. The function calls UNISWAP_V3_ORACLE.quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod to get the uniswapPriceFeed. For example, in the contract 0x5A9e6bCcF3257643a77189Bd78B34b84f298f3c6 which is the ARB/USDC price, getMarkPrice gets the ARB price in USDC, in 6 decimals. (1098227 at time of writing)

JOJOPriceFeed is received from EmergencyOracle.getMarkPrice(), which is 1103444 at time of writing

https://arbiscan.io/address/0x2cbf1b543c566bb34151a4a8ac4416739ffe96a0

The diff is calculated by subtracting both oracle prices  with each other, ie 1103444 - 1098277 = 5167

The require statement calculates diff * 1e18 / JOJOPriceFeed <= impact, impact is set to 5e16

5167 * 1e18 / 1103444 = 4.6826119e+15 which is lower than impact.

Finally, the function returns uniswapPriceFeed, which is 1098227.

```solidity

    getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 uniswapPriceFeed,) = IStaticOracle(UNISWAP_V3_ORACLE).quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod(uint128(10**decimal), baseToken, quoteToken, period);
        uint256 JOJOPriceFeed = EmergencyOracle(priceFeedOracle).getMarkPrice();
        uint256 diff = JOJOPriceFeed >= uniswapPriceFeed ? JOJOPriceFeed - uniswapPriceFeed : uniswapPriceFeed - JOJOPriceFeed;
        require(diff * 1e18 / JOJOPriceFeed <= impact, "deviation is too big");
        return uniswapPriceFeed;
    }
```

The issue is in the require statement. diff * 1e18 should be divided by uniswapPriceFeed instead of JOJOPriceFeed because we want to calculate the deviation of price from uniswapPriceFeed instead of JOJOPriceFeed. Here is a largely amplified example:

Let's say uniswap oracle returns token A as 1000 USDC. Emergencyoracle returns token A as 900 USDC. The deviation should be 10%. diff is 100. However, diff * 1e18 / 900 = 1.1111111e+17 (10.1111%), instead of diff * 1e18 / 1000 = 1e+17 (10%). 

## Impact

deviation is calculated against the wrong price which results in incorrect checks against impact.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use uniswapPriceFeed instead of JOJOPriceFeed. 

```solidity

    getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256) {
        (uint256 uniswapPriceFeed,) = IStaticOracle(UNISWAP_V3_ORACLE).quoteAllAvailablePoolsWithTimePeriod(uint128(10**decimal), baseToken, quoteToken, period);
        uint256 JOJOPriceFeed = EmergencyOracle(priceFeedOracle).getMarkPrice();
        uint256 diff = JOJOPriceFeed >= uniswapPriceFeed ? JOJOPriceFeed - uniswapPriceFeed : uniswapPriceFeed - JOJOPriceFeed;
-       require(diff * 1e18 / JOJOPriceFeed <= impact, "deviation is too big");
+      require(diff * 1e18 / uniswapPriceFeed <= impact, "deviation is too big");
        return uniswapPriceFeed;
    }
```

Also, I noticed that the emergency oracle updates the price quite infrequently, with the latest time gap of 8 hours, and may affect the  deviation and the whole protocol in general in case of a flashcrash. Consider updating the emergency oracle frequently or use another type of oracle to calculate the deviation.
