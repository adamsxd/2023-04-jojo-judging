# DepositStableCoinToDealer and GeneralRepay approval farming allows to steal all approved tokens

## Summary

Multiple contracts in scope have a call to `(bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);`

Because these contracts are meant to be called by anyone, an attacker can steal the tokens by populating `data` to perform a `transferFrom`

## Vulnerability Detail

DepositStableCoinToDealer is the simplest example, but all other contracts have the same risk

`DepositStableCoinToDealer` is meant to be granted user allowance, but can be called by anyone

Any outstanding allowance can be swept to the attacker thanks to arbitrary code execution in `swapTarget.call(data);`

- DepositStableCoinToDealer will receive approval from User A that performs a normal operation leaving some allowance left
- User B will call `depositStableCoin` with the lowest values that won't revert, for example doing a 1 wei transfer (even 0 should be fine) and doing a 1 wei deposit 
- They will pass `data` that will cause `(bool success, ) = swapTarget.call(data);` to perform: `STABLE_TOKEN.transferFrom(UserA, UserB, allOfUserABalancer)`

Which will allow userB to steal all of A tokens.

The above could also be performed by front-running A right after an approval

## Impact

Any outstanding allowance can be swept to the attacker thanks to arbitrary code execution in `swapTarget.call(data);`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Enforce that only one user can use `DepositStableCoinToDealer`
Alternatively, change the logic to remove the ability to sweep away tokens from other users
