# The multiCall function in the JUSDMulticall contract takes an array of callData and executes each call using delegatecall

## Summary

The multiCall function in the JUSDMulticall contract takes an array of callData and executes each call using delegatecall. The return values of each call are stored in an array returnData and returned at the end of the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

One potential security issue with this implementation is that it allows external callers to execute arbitrary code on the contract. This can be dangerous if the callData array contains malicious code that can exploit vulnerabilities in the contract or steal funds.

## Impact

executes each call using delegatecall ,such as selfdestruct()

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDMulticall.sol#L13

function multiCall(
        bytes[] memory callData
    ) external returns (bytes[] memory returnData) {
        returnData = new bytes[](callData.length);

        for (uint256 i; i < callData.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory res) = address(this).delegatecall(
                callData[i]
            );
            if (success == false) {
                assembly {
                    let ptr := mload(0x40)
                    let size := returndatasize()
                    returndatacopy(ptr, 0, size)
                    revert(ptr, size)
                }
            }
            returnData[i] = res;
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this risk, it is important to ensure that the callData array only contains trusted and validated function calls. Additionally, it is recommended to implement access controls to restrict who can call the multiCall function.
