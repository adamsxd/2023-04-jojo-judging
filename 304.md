# Unsafe Borrowers can Call Flashloan to Self-Liquidate Without Paying Insurance Fee

## Summary
When a borrower becomes unsafe, they can call flash loan to self-liquidate and gain profits without paying any fees to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Under normal situation in JUSD, liquidators are whitelisted (when enabled) and self-liquidate is not allowed. These checks are enforced in `liquidate` in JUSDBank.sol through `isValidLiquidator` hook. And the insuranceFee is mandatory and paid by liquidator. This is calculated based on collateral amount requested by the liquidator in `_calculateLiquidateAmount` and paid through a flashloan callback. Afterwards, the insuranceFee paid is checked in a require statement.

```solidity
    function isValidLiquidator(
        address liquidated,
        address liquidator
    ) internal view {
        require(
            liquidator != liquidated,
            JUSDErrors.SELF_LIQUIDATION_NOT_ALLOWED
        );
        if (isLiquidatorWhitelistOpen) {
            require(
                isLiquidatorWhiteList[liquidator],
                JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATOR_NOT_IN_THE_WHITELIST
            );
        }
    }
```
```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(insurance) -
                primaryInsuranceAmount >=
                liquidateData.insuranceFee,
            JUSDErrors.INSURANCE_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        );
```
However, these checks will all be bypassed if a borrower becomes unsafe and self-liquidate their accounts through `flashLoan` in JUSDBank.sol. The flashloan function allows anyone to use and withdraw their collaterals without checking whether account is safe to begin with. Furthermore, the flash loan by design doesn't check if the amount withdrew is returned as long as the caller's account is safe afterwards. The missing checks open up opportunities for exploit.

First, an unsafe borrower can call flash loan and get an advance of all their collaterals to sell and trade. Second, the function calls a user specified flashLoan receiver contract where they can sell the collaterals received in the receiver function and repay minimal part of the loan. Third, the user's account is considered safe. No insurance fee needs to be paid. This can be profitable for the borrowers when collaterals can be sold at a higher price. 

[Here is a test to show the above process and results. ](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/dbb2a004b2d9a573f413fa4735d1d6ec)

## Impact
1. This allows unsafe account to self-liquidate which is not allowed under normal liquidation process. 
2. Through self-liquidation, unsafe borrowers do not have to pay insurance fees that are mandatory during normal liquidation process, reducing the protocol's ability to cover bad debts.

        _withdraw(amount, collateral, receiver, msg.sender, false);
        // repay
        IFlashLoanReceive(receiver).JOJOFlashLoan(
            collateral,
            amount,
            to,
            param
        );
        require(
            _isAccountSafe(user, getTRate()),
            JUSDErrors.AFTER_FLASHLOAN_ACCOUNT_IS_NOT_SAFE
        );
        emit FlashLoan(collateral, amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Flashloans shouldn't be taken advantaged by unsafe borrowers. Add check before `_withdraw` to ensure only safe accounts can use Flashloan.
2. Consider limit the flash loan functionality by checking whether the collateral amount withdrew is returned.
