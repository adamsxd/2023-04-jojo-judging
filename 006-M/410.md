# Contract does not account for the possibility of the sequencer being down

## Summary

There is a bug in the getAssetPrice() function of the JOJOOracleAdaptor contract, which does not account for the possibility of the sequencer being down. We should check for that as described in the code snippet below below. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The getAssetPrice() function in the JOJOOracleAdaptor contract retrieves the latest price data from Chainlink oracles but it does not check whether the sequencer is down

This can lead to the prices being falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down, resulting in potential inaccuracies in the reported asset price.

## Impact

The absence of a check for the sequencer's status can cause potential inaccuracies in the reported asset price, which may lead to incorrect trading and investment decisions on the JOJO Exchange platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, it is recommended to implement a check for the sequencer's status like described [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) : 

```solidity


      (
            /*uint80 roundID*/,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            /*uint256 updatedAt*/,
            /*uint80 answeredInRound*/
        ) = sequencerUptimeFeed.latestRoundData();

        // Answer == 0: Sequencer is up
        // Answer == 1: Sequencer is down
        bool isSequencerUp = answer == 0;
        if (!isSequencerUp) {
            revert SequencerDown();
        }

```
