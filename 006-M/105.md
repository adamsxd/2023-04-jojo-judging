# getMarkPrice() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in chainlinkAdaptor.sol

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. 

The sequencer being down has happened in the past - [Arbitrum sequencer suffers 10 hours outage](https://thedefiant.io/arbitrum-outage-2)

This will lead to wrong prices and malicious actors potentially exploiting the protocol and the users.
## Vulnerability Detail
The required check to make sure the sequencer is active is not present in the code
```solidity
    function getMarkPrice() external view returns (uint256 price) {
        int256 rawPrice;
        uint256 updatedAt;
        (, rawPrice, , updatedAt, ) = IChainlink(chainlink).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 USDCPrice,, uint256 USDCUpdatedAt,) = IChainlink(USDCSource).latestRoundData();
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= heartbeatInterval,
            "ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED"
        );
        require(block.timestamp - USDCUpdatedAt <= heartbeatInterval, "USDC_ORACLE_HEARTBEAT_FAILED");
        uint256 tokenPrice = (SafeCast.toUint256(rawPrice) * 1e8) / SafeCast.toUint256(USDCPrice);
        return tokenPrice * 1e18 / decimalsCorrection;
    }
``` 
## Impact
This may result in an unexpected price if the sequencer is down, opening the possibility for malicious actors to exploit the protocol.

## Recommendation
Implement a method to check if the sequencer is down. Follow the Chainlink docs for dealing with EVM chains: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code
