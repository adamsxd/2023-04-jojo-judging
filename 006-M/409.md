# Missing check for active Arbitrum Sequencer in `JOJOOracleAdapter.sol` & `ChainlinkAdapter.sol`

## Summary
This is mentioned that
>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
>
>  - Arbitrum

You should always check for sequencer availability when using Chainlink's Arbitrum price feeds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum sequencer is active

https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#l2-sequencer-uptime-feeds

If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact
If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, oracle data will not be kept up to date, and thus could become stale.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
