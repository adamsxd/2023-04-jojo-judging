# ChainlinkExpandAdaptor does not check whether L2 sequencer is up

## Summary
ChainlinkExpandAdaptor does not check whether L2 sequencer is up.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since Arbitrium has its own sequencer; block.timestamp only reflects the L1 timestamp on ethereum. It's possible that block.timestamp is delayed since Arbitrium only finalized on L1 every 40mins, potentially using old price from pricefeed in oracle.

## Impact
Using old price from pricefeed in oracle due to unchecked timestamp difference esp when sequencer is down.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer uptime check by using a [chainlink oracle](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-use-chainlink-price-feeds-on-arbitrum/#almost_done!_meet_the_l2_sequencer_health_flag)
