# Lack of Access Control in JOJOExternal.setOperator

## Summary

The setOperator function in JOJOExternal contract does not have proper access control, which can lead to unauthorized changes to the operatorRegistry variable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The setOperator function in JOJOExternal allows the owner to add or remove an operator from the operatorRegistry variable. However, there is no check to ensure that the caller is the owner, which means that any user can call this function and modify the operatorRegistry variable. This can lead to unauthorized access to the system, and the user can potentially cause financial loss.

## Impact

The vulnerability can potentially lead to financial loss as any user can modify the operatorRegistry variable, which allows them to perform unauthorized operations in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this vulnerability, it is recommended to add proper access control to the setOperator function. This can be achieved by adding a modifier to the function to check if the caller is the owner. Additionally, it is recommended to use a library that provides safe math operations to avoid integer overflows and underflows.
