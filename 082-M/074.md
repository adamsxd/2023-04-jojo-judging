# JUSDBank should mint/burn JUSD instead of only transferring it

## Summary
The JUSDBank should be minting & burning JUSD instead of transferring it around when a user borrows or repays JUSD.

## Vulnerability Detail
Borrowing JUSD from JUSDBank is supposed to be the only way to get any fresh JUSD. But, the bank contract never mints any new tokens. Instead, it expects to have a certain amount of JUSD tokens assigned to it that it can lend to users.
Meaning, the actual owner of JUSD is not the bank contract but some other address. Most likely an EOA/Multsig the protocol team controls. That address has to fund the bank for it to be able to operate properly.

## Impact
Multiple issues arise from that design:
**1. `JUSD.totalSupply()` doesn't represent the actual amount of JUSD that's in circulation.**
Any JUSD assigned to JUSDBank isn't in circulation. For those tokens to enter the market, they have to be borrowed by someone first. That breaks the ERC20 standard because `totalSupply` doesn't really represent the number of tokens that were borrowed. Additionally, this will artificially inflate the token's market cap. By funding JUSDBank with billions of JUSD the market cap will be billions of dollars as well ($1 * totalSupply) which is not really the case since no one borrowed those tokens. 
**2. JUSDBank might run out of funds in volalite market conditions**
The crypto market is inherently unpredictable. There's the possibility of the JUSDBank contract running out of JUSD to lend out causing the lending market to halt until the protocol team adds additional funds. While that is only a temporary issue, it breaks the design philosophy of the token: put down X amount of collateral to borrow Y amount of JUSD at any time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
JUSDBank should be the owner of the JUSD token. When a user borrows JUSD it should mint fresh tokens. When the user repays their debt, it should burn those tokens.
