# Project doesn't comply with EIP-20

## Summary
JOJO Exchange is not compliant with EIP-20

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the docs, JOJO Exchange is expected to comply with any EIPs
> Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
expected to comply with any EIPs

EIP-20 [states](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#:~:text=Callers%20MUST%20handle%20false%20from%20returns%20(bool%20success).%20Callers%20MUST%20NOT%20assume%20that%20false%20is%20never%20returned!) that wherever `bool` values are returned, they MUST be handled: 
> Callers MUST handle false from returns (bool success). Callers MUST NOT assume that false is never returned!

Everywhere where `.approve` is used, the value returned is not handled in any way.
```solidity
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, 0);
        IERC20(asset).approve(approveTarget, amount);
```
Therefore, the code is not EIP-20 compliant, when it is expected to be. 

## Impact
JOJO Exchange doesn't comply with EIP-20, when it is expected to comply with any EIP
