# Unrestricted Owner Control Over Funding Rates

## Summary

The owner of the Perpetual contract has unrestricted control over funding rates, which can lead to an unfair advantage and market manipulation.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Perpetual contract, the updateFundingRate function allows the contract owner to update the funding rate without any constraints. A malicious owner can exploit this to manipulate the funding rate arbitrarily, leading to unfair liquidations or affecting the credit of other traders.

## Impact

A malicious owner can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate the funding rate, leading to potential unfair liquidations, affecting the credit of other traders, and ultimately damaging the integrity of the market.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, implement a mechanism that restricts the owner's control over funding rates. For example, use an oracle or decentralized governance system to determine the funding rate, or implement rate limits that restrict how much the funding rate can be changed within a given period.
