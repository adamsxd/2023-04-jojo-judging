# JUSD depeg could prevent liquidation of unhealthy positions in JOJODealer causing it to accumulate large amount of bad debts


## Summary
`JOJODealer` allows JUSD to be used as credits with an 1:1 exchange rate against JUSDC. However, if JUSD is underpegged to JUSDC, it will cause the protocol to accumulate large amount of debts that cannot be liquidated before JUSD crashes further, leading to huge losses for the protocol.


## Vulnerability Detail

JUSD is allowed to be used as a secondary credit for trading on `JOJODealer` and it is treated as equal value to primary asset (USDC) in the JOJO system, according to the docs.

However, that is not guaranteed to be true as JUSD is still a collateral backed stablecoin. That means during market volatility, collateral value could drop significantly, causing JUSD to depeg and experience significant drop in value against USDC. That will affect the solvency of JOJO system.

First, let us understand how JOJO system maintains its solvency:

The `Perpetual.liquidate()` function serves to keep the JOJO system solvent by allowing liquidation of unhealthy positions before they crash further and turn into bad debts.

A position is considered unhealthy using `Liquidation._isSafe()`, which checks that the sum of position value and trader's USD/JUSD balances are greater than the maintenance margin. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/main/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L87-L104

```Solidity
netPositionValue + state.primaryCredit[trader] + SafeCast.toInt256(state.secondaryCredit[trader]) >= SafeCast.toInt256(maintenanceMargin);`
```

The issue is that the market value of JUSD (`state.secondaryCredit[trader]`) is not reflected in the margin check. When JUSD drops in value and far below margin requirements, the `_isSafe()` prevents the position from being liquidated, even when it is in actual fact, unhealthy.

Imagine a simple scenario as follows:
1. Trader open position with X JUSD.
2. JUSD depegs and actual value of position is < maintenance margin. However the position cannot be liquidated as JUSD is treated as equal in value to USDC. 
3. JUSD drops further to zero.
4. His position is now heavily underwater and the protocol has to absorb the bad debts as trader is not incentivised to top up margin and no liquidator will save it.


## Impact

When the bad debts accumulate due to the JUSD depeg, the protocol will suffer loss and users might not be able to withdraw their USDC as well.

## Recommendation

Use actual market value of JUSD in `_isSafe()` and `_isSolidSafe()`. Consider adding a max amount of JUSD in the JOJOSystem to manage risk of JUSD depeg.
