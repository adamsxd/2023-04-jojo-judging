# The calculation of `timeDifference` in `getTRate` is incorrect

## Summary

The calculation of `timeDifference` in `getTRate` is incorrect as it does not properly account for each individual borrower's timestamp at which they first borrowed JUSD.

## Vulnerability Detail

JOJO's calculation for `timeDifference` in the [`getTRate` function](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDBankStorage.sol#L51), which is how the current interest percentage is determined for a borrower, is not correctly tabulating the time difference for each borrower. Instead, `getTRate` uses the timestamp at which the borrow rate is set. However, `lastUpdateTimestamp` is only updated when the [`borrowFeeRate` is updated](https://github.com/JOJOexchange/JUSDV1/blob/011e10d36257a404c8c1d7d2b8c9f01a2b7a1969/src/Impl/JUSDOperation.sol#L170) and not each time a borrower interacts with the protocol. This means a borrower's interest rate will constantly accumulate over time, instead of being amortized over the time difference in which they last interacted with the protocol.

## Impact

A borrower may end up paying dramatically more in interest than expected. Additionally, new borrowers will end up paying interest over a period of time that they did not borrow for. For example, in the case where the `borrowFeeRate` has not been updated in a year, a new borrower will end up paying interest as if they have held a borrow for a year instead of for the initial time of the `t0Rate`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
    return
        t0Rate +
        (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
        JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing either of the following suggestions for correctly tabulating interest per borrower:

1. A borrower's account should store the initial `block.timestamp` of when they borrowed JUSD. Then, each time a borrower interacts with the protocol, their interest is calculated from the saved timestamp to the current `block.timestamp` where this time difference is used in the `getTRate` calculation. The interest should then be added to the amount borrowed and the timestamp in the borrower's account should be updated. This 'checkpoints' the interest accrual upon each interaction with the lending contract.
2. The `JUSDBank` contract tabulates the interest accrued on the total borrows each time any user interacts with the protocol, and then calculates the amount of interest owed per-user by determining the individual amount borrowed relative to the total amount borrowed.

In both instances, the interest is tabulated per-interaction. This is accomplished by amortizing the interest rate over one year, and caching the last block timestamp interest was accounted for. Then, the protocol is able to apply interest to a user or a borrow pool based on the time difference from the last interaction.
