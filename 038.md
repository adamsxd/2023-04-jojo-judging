# function getTRate() will be incorrect during a leap year

## Summary
The t rate will be incorrect during a leap year. Because it uses a constant SECONDS_PER_YEAR (which IMO is misleading) as 365 days. However it will be incorrect during a leap year which has 366 days in a year.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function getTRate calculates the T rate with the following formula 

``function getTRate() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 timeDifference = block.timestamp - uint256(lastUpdateTimestamp);
        return
            t0Rate +
            (borrowFeeRate * timeDifference) /
            JOJOConstant.SECONDS_PER_YEAR;
    }``

the SECONDS_PER_YEAR JOJO constant is as follows 

``uint256 public constant SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 365 days;``

This will be incorrect during a leap year which has 366 days 



## Impact
The function getTRate() will be incorrect during a leap year (e.g. 2024)
