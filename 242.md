# Shorters pay more insurance fee than long position

## Summary
`insuranceFee = LiquidatorCreditChange âˆ— insuranceFeeRate` is wrong because the insuranceFee is deducted from liquidatedCreditChange, not liquidatorCreditChange.

## Vulnerability Detail
The formula in [docs](https://jojo-docs.netlify.app/insurance#insurance-fee) and [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/6090fef68932b5577abf6b5aa26eb1e579353c57/smart-contract-EVM/contracts/lib/Liquidation.sol#L279-L324) are as follows
$liquidatorCreditChange = paperChange * Price * (1 \pm threshold)$
$insuranceFee = liquidatorCreditChange.abs() * insuranceFeeRate$
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[liquidatorCreditChange + insuranceFee]$

For short position: paperChange is positive, so addition are punishment
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[paperChange * Price * (1 + threshold) * (1 + insuranceFeeRate)]$
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[paperChange * Price * (1 + threshold + insuranceFeeRate + (threshold * insuranceFeeRate))]$

For long position: paperChange is negative, so subtraction are punishment
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[paperChange * Price * (1 - threshold) * (1 - insuranceFeeRate)]$
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[paperChange * Price * (1 - threshold - insuranceFeeRate + (threshold * insuranceFeeRate))]$

$threshold * insuranceFeeRate$ is added to short position normal rate, while it is removed from long position normal rate. If `threshold = 5%` and `insuranceFeeRate = 5%`, then `threshold * insuranceFeeRate = 0.25%`. This might seem small but considering that it is a percentage of the total exposure of a perp, it starts getting scary.

**The correct formula ought to be**
$liquidatedCreditChange = -[paperChange * price * (1 \pm threshold \pm insuranceFee)]$
$liquidatorCreditChange = paperChange * price * (1 \pm threshold)$
$insuranceFee = paperChange.abs() * price * insuranceFee$


## Impact
$threshold * insuranceFeeRate$ is added to short position normal rate, while it is removed from long position normal rate. If `threshold = 5%` and `insuranceFeeRate = 5%`, then `threshold * insuranceFeeRate = 0.25%`. This might seem small but considering that it is a percentage of the total exposure of a perp, it starts getting scary.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change insurance Fee formula
```sol
- insuranceFee =
-            (liqtorCreditChange.abs() * params.insuranceFeeRate) /
-           Types.ONE;

+ insuranceFee =
+            (liqtorPaperChange.abs() * price * params.insuranceFeeRate) /
+            Types.ONE;
```

The cause of the mistake might be because the team treats the insurance fee just like [JUSDV1 Bank](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-jojo/blob/6090fef68932b5577abf6b5aa26eb1e579353c57/JUSDV1/src/Impl/JUSDBank.sol#L408). It's important to note internally that they are different cause insurance fee is paid by the liquidator in JUSDV1, but by liquidated in smart-contract-EVM
