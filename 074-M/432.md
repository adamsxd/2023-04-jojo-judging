# _isSafe and _isSolidSafe could become unavailable due to DoS

## Summary
`_isSafe` and `_isSolidSafe` will revert if `state.openPositions[trader].length` is too big
## Vulnerability Detail
Above functions are used when calculating if a position is liquidatable.  
Both call `getTotalExposure` which illiterates over `state.openPositions[trader]`.
Since the array is never decreased, over time or when a user sends multiple 0 value trades (which is not checked), it will get too big and revert when used by `getTotalExposure`
## Impact
Liquidations become unavailable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Decrease `state.openPositions[trader]` when a trade is closed and prevent 0 value trades from increasing it
