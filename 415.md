# Blacklisted users can not be liquidated if liquidateAmount > JUSDBorrowed

## Summary

A USDC blacklisted address can not be liquidated if `liquidateRemainUSDC` >0 since transferring USDC to the blacklisted user will revert the transaction. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `JUSDBANK#liquidate()` we see the following require statement:

```solidity
        require(
            IERC20(primaryAsset).balanceOf(liquidated) -
                primaryLiquidatedAmount >=
                liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC,
            JUSDErrors.LIQUIDATED_AMOUNT_NOT_ENOUGH
        )
```

Where `primaryLiquidateAmount` is the USDC balance before the liquidation. This require statements can only be passed if USDC is transferred to the blacklisted users in `JUSDBank#_afterLiquidateOperation()` or if `primaryLiquidateAmount`==0.

`liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC` is >0 if `liquidateAmount` > `JUSDBorrowed` as seen in `JUSDBank#_calcLiquidateAmount`:

```solidity
    function _calculateLiquidateAmount(
		...
		...
        if (liquidateAmount <= JUSDBorrowed) {
            liquidateData.actualCollateral = amount;
            liquidateData.insuranceFee = amount.decimalMul(priceOff).decimalMul(
                reserve.insuranceFeeRate
            );
            liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidateAmount.decimalDiv(
                tRate
            );
            liquidateData.actualLiquidated = liquidateAmount;
        } else {
            liquidateData.actualCollateral = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalDiv(priceOff)
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate);
            liquidateData.insuranceFee = JUSDBorrowed
                .decimalMul(reserve.insuranceFeeRate) 
                .decimalDiv(JOJOConstant.ONE - reserve.insuranceFeeRate)
            liquidateData.actualLiquidatedT0 = liquidatedInfo.t0BorrowBalance;
            liquidateData.actualLiquidated = JUSDBorrowed;
        }

        liquidateData.liquidatedRemainUSDC = (amount -
            liquidateData.actualCollateral).decimalMul(price);
        ...
        ...
```

When this is the case liquidations will fail since transfers to blacklisted USDC users revert.

## Impact

Liquidators are incentivized to liquidate as much collateral as possible since their profit is proportional to the amount liquidated. It is reasonable to assume that some will purposefully use `amounts` where `liquidateAmount` > `JUSDBorrowed` to guarantee that the maximum amount is liquidated to account for changes in price. This will always fail for blacklisted users.

The consequence is that blacklisted users are protected from these kinds of liquidations, this is unfair and could increase the risk of protocol debt.

Manual Review, vscode, foundry

## Recommendation

Use internal accounting and allow liquidated users to pull out their USDC instead of transferring it during liquidation.
